/// [`NodePath`] is versioned, meaning that it will always point to the exact

/// of [`NodePath`] will still point to the original version.
///
/// ## Implementation Note
///
/// Right now, this struct only contains a [`NodeHash`], and is thus redundant.
/// But at some point, it will become possible to build identical expressions in
/// different parts of the syntax tree. That's when we're going to need this
/// struct.
///
/// And I want to already distinguish between this and [`NodeHash`] right now,
/// to make the API more clear, and to not require an eventual transition.
///
/// The specific change that will make this struct necessary, is supporting
/// syntax nodes with multiple children. (Thus turning the syntax tree into an
/// actual tree.) Once that is possible, we'll need two additional pieces of
/// data here, to uniquely identity a syntax node:
///
/// - The location of the parent node.
/// - The index of the child node, within the parent node's children.

    /// children, is actually enough to do that.
