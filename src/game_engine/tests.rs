use crate::game_engine::{GameEngine, GameOutput};

// All tests in this module are currently broken. I (Hanno Braun) did that
// accidentally, when making a change to the game engine, forgetting to re-run
// the tests.
//
// What's important to note though, is that the functionality covered by the
// tests itself is not broken (supposedly; there no longer are any tests ðŸ˜‚).
// What's broken is the mechanism that all of the tests are using to observe the
// game engine's behavior.
//
// I decided not to fix this immediately. I'm currently working through an
// important decision that could have a big effect on the syntax. In that case,
// fixing these tests would be absolutely trivial.
//
// Right now, it wouldn't be. Any fix would make the tests more complicated. So
// I think it's fine to wait for a bit, as that syntax decision is the higher
// priority anyway.
