The type system needs to [support nominal typing](/daily/2025-03-10), but I
don't want to add a separate set of types just for that. I want a design that is
[simple, orthogonal, and composable](/daily/2025-02-28), and that means there
should be one construct to take _any_ type (which are all structural by default)
and make it nominal. Something like this:

```
Address := nominal record { street: Text, house_number: Integer }
```

That's it. Just add `nominal`, and now `Address` is a nominal type. Where your
code expects an `Address`, another
`record { street: Text, house_number: Integer }` will not be accepted. (Again,
the `:=` syntax is just shorthand for "a name was assigned _somehow_".)

Please note that there's one interesting consequence arising from this design:
Since making a type nominal and assigning a name to it are orthogonal concepts,
it becomes possible to create types that are both nominal and anonymous. This
seems nonsensical, but it's probably fine. As long as each element is simple and
can be understood well, it's just a harmless quirk.
