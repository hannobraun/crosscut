Newer functional languages like [Koka] and [Unison] _do not_ necessarily track
side effects by passing values between functions. They use
[algebraic effects](/daily/2024-12-10). And with algebraic effects, you can
write [yesterday's example](/daily/2025-04-26) as a series of statements, just
like you would in an imperative language.

I think this is what that would look like in Unison, for example:

```
do_a
then_do_b
lastly_do_c
```

And despite this _looking_ pretty much the same as imperative code with implicit
side effects, the effects of each function are known to the compiler. You could
look them up in the function definitions. In Crosscut, the editor could display
the effects for you very explicitly, right where you use those effectful
functions.

Over the last few months, I had gotten used to the functional "single
expression" style. It took me a bit, to adjust to the thought of returning to
the whole "series of statements" thing. But now I think that is a win. Algebraic
effects retain the stringency of purely functional programming, while putting
that in a syntactical package that is already familiar to most developers.
