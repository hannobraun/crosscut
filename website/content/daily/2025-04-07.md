There's another consideration when deciding whether to build the next editor
[with web technologies](/daily/2025-04-05), or whether to go with a custom
solution based on [the bare GPU](/daily/2025-04-06): Crosscut code should be
able to expand the editor UI.

Specifically, Crosscut libraries should be able to ship with custom UI elements
to visualize and edit their core data types. (I
[wrote about that](/daily/2024-09-20) before.) That should be a simple thing to
do, so I wouldn't want to prescribe using web technologies for that. (Nor would
I want to invite the bloat that would probably result from this decision.)

So those editor extensions would probably be based on custom technology (or
re-use something simple). With a web-based editor, there would be the question
of how to integrate that. While with a custom-built UI, we'd have a lot of
flexibility, even to the point of fully re-using the custom UI framework for
these extensions.
