When talking about imperative-looking functional code, I think it makes sense to
mention `do`-notation again. It is an alternative syntax (available
[in Haskell], for example) that enables just that. But it never made sense to
me. Why have two syntaxes? If neither by itself is good enough, what does that
say about your language?

My unofficial language design consultant [Adrian] told me recently, that
`do`-notation was [added to Haskell] as a later alternative to the "prime"
syntax, and that indeed he's using it as the default. So maybe this is part of a
larger trend towards more imperative syntax in functional programming. (Although
there seems to be [some controversy].)

Either way, it's clear there's _some_ need for a more imperative style of
functional programming. And maybe algebraic effects can
[fill that role](/daily/2025-04-27) for new languages. Without the need for
adding an alternative notation, which I definitely don't want to do in Crosscut.
