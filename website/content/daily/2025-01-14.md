There's an obvious way to address
[the problem of the code database](/daily/2025-01-11) in the new prototype: Just
include it from the beginning. And that's what I've been doing.

I had initially planned to implement the ["checkout" model](/daily/2024-12-31),
because that seems easier and allows for reusing established editors. I had also
planned to include a debugger again (more on that later), but with a very
minimalist command-line interface that can render code and parse simple
commands.

But before I had the opportunity to go down that road, I looked at my plans for
this debugger CLI and had another one of my "how hard could it be" moments:
Could I just implement [a whole editor](/daily/2025-01-03) like this? Well, not
exactly, but maybe with a Vim-like interface? I already started regretting that,
but now I seem to be over that first hump. We'll see how it goes.
