Not everything in my life is as secure as I want it to be. My
[current source of income] is one example. And while I handle this well (it
doesn't cause me stress), it did result in some mental overhead. Whenever there
was a significant change, I started reconsidering my options. Thinking about if
and when it would make sense to change my approach.

A few months back, I decided that I should deal with this problem in a more
principled manner. So I sat down and developed a clear and actionable Plan B,
for what I would do if my income failed. More importantly, I set objective
criteria for when Plan B would activate. Right away, that provided a lot of
clarity.

And there was a secondary effect, also positive. In multiple ways, that Plan B
would present a clear cut for me. Away from frivolous pursuits, towards more
serious efforts that had a better chance of sustaining me (financially) in the
short term. This mirrored [how I thought](/daily/2024-11-01) about Crosscut's
use case, and started to affect my views on that topic.
