I've been talking about traits for a few days now
([starting here](/daily/2025-06-14)). So far, I've been using Rust's traits as a
template, which are focused on defining a set of methods, and that set of
methods must be implemented for any type that implements the trait.

But this focus on a single type implementing a trait is not really necessary.
Instead, we could define a set of multiple abstract types, and a set of
functions that operate on them. This concept already exists, for example in the
form of Haskell's [multi-parameter type classes].

Tomorrow, let's look at a concrete example of what that could look like.
