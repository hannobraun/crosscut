Postfix syntax has advantages over prefix syntax, but
[you can offset those](/daily/2025-02-13). And there is at least one genuine
advantage that prefix syntax has over postfix (besides familiarity; which, to
me, doesn't count). Because this is shit:

```
condition
then_case
else_case
	if
```

This is a fictional postfix syntax for an `if` expression. And I don't like it,
because I have to read three distinct pieces of code (condition, "then" case,
"else" case) before I'm told the context (`if`) that could help me understand
this.

We can make that a bit better by being more explicit:

```
{
	condition: ...
    then: ...
    else: ...
}
	if
```

At least this way, you see a record type that starts with a `condition` field,
and can pretty much assume what this is going to be. But it's not the same as
knowing the context of what's happening from the start. Like you would, if this
was using prefix syntax, and `if` was the first thing you saw.
