So yeah, whether I'll build a [custom command-line editor](/daily/2025-01-12)
for the code database (maybe something Vim-like?), or whether I'll give up on
that and revert to the ["checkout" model](/daily/2024-12-31), that remains to be
seen.

But either way, it's clear to me that the new prototype needs to be built on top
of a [code database](/daily/2024-07-29). The code database has been such a
central concept in my planning so far. I simply can't afford to leave it for
later. I either need that foundation from the start; or I need to know that it
won't work, so I can discard the concept.

And that's one of the central questions that the
[new prototype](/daily/2025-01-08) is there to answer.
