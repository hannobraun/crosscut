I mentioned the [two big problems](/daily/2025-01-21) caused by my choice of
syntax and evaluation model in the previous prototype. Let's start with the
uniqueness of the design.

I guess this problem is straight-forward: I'm simply not aware a purely
functional programming language that is taking inspiration from concatenative
languages, is somewhat but not fully stack-based, has a static type system with
type inference, etc. Whenever I ran into any design problem, I was mostly on my
own.

And to an extent, that's fine. I want to create something that's better than the
status quo, and that necessarily means deviating from it. But I have to pick my
battles. The core of Crosscut is interactive programming. Immediacy. Everything
that diverts my focus from that, is a distraction. I need to get this essential
thing right, before I can spend my limited resources in other areas.
