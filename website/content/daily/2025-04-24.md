Algebraic effects are syntactically lightweight and a very powerful tool. They
currently are my preferred solution for error handling, over a Rust-style
approach; and for tracking side effects, [over linear types](/daily/2025-04-19).

I [wrote about algebraic effects before](/daily/2024-12-10) and I don't want to
repeat myself too much. But there's one aspect to adopting them that has become
clear to me only recently. And that's the profound (and, I think, positive!)
impact they have on the syntax of the language.

All of that is not going to fit into this last paragraph though, so let's
continue with that topic tomorrow.
