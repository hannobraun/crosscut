The evaluation model of the previous prototype (which resulted from my choice of
postfix syntax) caused many problems. I've already
[presented some examples](/daily/2025-01-24). And I swear, the plan up until
yesterday, was to present you with the solution I had chosen, right here and
now. I have a fully written draft! But no, not today, as it turns out ðŸ˜„

When I made the choice to start a new prototype, I knew that I wanted to keep
the syntax easy, for the time being. A known quantity. And my first thought was
to use [S-expressions], or something closely inspired by them. As time went on
(it's already been three weeks!), I changed my aim towards a model more inspired
by the [Haskell]/[ML] family of functional languages.

For reasons I won't go into today, I have doubts about both models. Meanwhile, I
had started thinking about a new concept based on postfix syntax. This morning,
both those doubts and my ideas about the new concept reached a critical mass.
And I'm no longer sure what to do.

I see a long series of thoughts about that coming. But for now, let's move on
with the [list of problems](/daily/2025-01-10) of the previous prototype.
