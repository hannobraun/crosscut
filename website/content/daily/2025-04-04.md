The current editor is terminal-based. (I [showed a demo](/daily/2025-04-02) of
that the other day.) I intended this terminal editor to be an easy-to-build
placeholder, to allow me to focus on other things for the time being, but I
hoped it would carry the project for a while. Now, I'm not confident that this
is going to be true for very long.

I already [started running into limitations] with certain convenience features.
(And those might be skill issues on my part, but they are hurdles nonetheless.)
But convenience doesn't need to be a priority right now, so this is not too much
of a problem.

The bigger issue is, that the structural code editing can be quite confusing. I
think this can be solved with better presentation, like graphical hints and
animations. Not all of that is going to be possible in the terminal. And even
where it is, the investment might not be wise, versus just switching focus to a
more advanced technology right away.
