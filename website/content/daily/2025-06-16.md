Yesterday I presented an example of a [trait in Rust](/daily/2025-06-15). Here's
that trait again:

```rust
trait Format {
    fn format(self) -> String;
}
```

Now, let's define a struct with a method:

```rust
struct MyFormat {}

impl MyFormat {
	fn format(self) -> String {
		String::from("This is a placeholder.")
	}
}
```

This method matches the one in the trait exactly. But if we tried to pass an
instance of this struct to yesterday's function, that would not work! Traits in
Rust are _nominal_. If we want to use a struct (or any other value), as an
implementation of a trait, we have to implement that trait _explicitly_:

```rust
struct MyFormat {}

impl Format for MyFormat {
	fn format(self) -> String {
		String::from("This is a placeholder.")
	}
}
```

Note how we need to mention `Format` in the `impl` block. This isn't right or
wrong. I'm not criticizing Rust here. I just want to note that this _could_ be
different. We could type traits _structurally_, and accept any type as an
instance of a trait that meets its requirements. And in fact, many languages do
that. Popular examples would be [TypeScript] and [Go].
