Yesterday, I talked about boring expressions that turn
[`nothing` into `nothing`](/daily/2025-02-17). Let's look at a more interesting
one today:

```
127
```

This is an integer literal. In Crosscut (at least the current iteration),
literals are just functions. In this case, a function that happens to take
`nothing` as input and return `127` as output. Right now, there's only one type
of integer (signed, 32-bit). But that's going to change as the language
develops.

Here's another expression:

```
127 255
```

Again we start with `nothing`, which the application of the function `127`
transforms into the value `127`. That value is different from `nothing`, which
is what `255` (like all integer literals) expects. This results in an error.

This approach is different from earlier prototypes that also used postfix
syntax, but with a stack-based evaluation model. There, the same code would have
resulted in a stack with two values on it.
