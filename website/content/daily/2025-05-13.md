The combination of restricted structural editing and postfix syntax introduces
[a lot of friction](/daily/2025-05-12) into day-to-day editing. What could we do
to address that?

- We could _not_ have restricted structural editing, but then we'd have to deal
  with [the problems of free-form structural editing](/daily/2025-05-03). This
  seems like a bad trade-off.
- We could circumvent the problem, by having special syntax for function
  literals and other things. I think that's going to happen anyway at some
  point, but for now, it would be a distraction from more important things.
- We could find innovative solutions to those problems. But that would take a
  lot of effort that I couldn't spend elsewhere, for uncertain gain.

Switching to prefix syntax avoids this problem, [and others](/daily/2025-05-07).
I think that's simply the best solution right now.
