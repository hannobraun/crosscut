Let's recap: From the start, Crosscut (then called "Caterpillar") used postfix
operators. Meaning, you don't write `1 + 2` or `+ 1 2`, but `1 2 +`. I'm not
going to explain or justify that here, because I
[already did so at length](/daily/2024-05-03). With the new prototype, I wanted
to (temporarily) try something else, but then
[changed my mind](/daily/2025-02-05).

One thing I realized through that process, is that I had underestimated the
importance of syntax. Yes, I did care enough about it to choose the least common
model, because I considered (and still do) that to be the best fit for this
language. But beyond that, I always (naively!) thought, that I could just change
the syntax later, if it turned out to be no good.

I now understand that syntax is the surface-level expression of the underlying
evaluation model, and thus closely tied to it. You can't just change one and not
adapt the other. Any mismatch will result in weirdness and complexity. Which is
why I've abandoned my plan to go with something tried and true for now. Because
that's not a decision I can easily reverse.
