I wonder if my idea from yesterday, to always
[automatically apply](/daily/2025-03-20) any function `A -> B` to any
`variant { A, ... }`, turning it into a `variant { B, ... }`, is practical. If
it is, that has profound consequences for error handling, and potentially other
areas of the language.

A few months back, I published a series about
[algebraic effects](/daily/2024-12-10). While I found a lot to like about them,
it turned out they [don't interact well](/daily/2024-12-24) with linear types.
So I've been thinking about alternatives.

Using variant types in this way could be a solution, at least for error
handling. We wouldn't need an error effect, or early returns, nor would we need
to deal with monads. Functions could be straight-forward, linear series of
instructions, with [a single exit point](/daily/2024-08-26) at the end.
