There's an obvious way to address
[the problem of the code database](/daily/2025-01-11) in the new prototype: Just
include it from the beginning. And that's what I've been doing.

I initially planned to implement the ["checkout" model](/daily/2024-12-31),
because that seems easier and allows for reusing existing editors. I had also
planned to include a debugger again (more on that later), but this time built in
a very minimal way; using some shitty command-line interface that can render
code and parse simple commands.

But before I had the opportunity to go down that road, I looked at the shitty
CLI I was planning, and had another one of my "how hard could it be" moments:
Could I just implement [a whole editor](/daily/2025-01-03) this way? So that's
what I've been trying to do. I already started regretting it. But now I seem to
be over that first hump, and the sailing is smooth again. For now.
