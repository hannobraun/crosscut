I recently [expressed worry](/daily/2025-03-14) about the interaction of move
semantics and nominally typed records, if nominal typing implies that the fields
of the record are private. But after [working out](/daily/2025-03-15) how move
semantics and records could actually interact, I'm no longer worried.

In contrast to Rust, every result of moving a value into or out of a record,
would result in a fully usable record with a well-defined type. That's something
you can easily build an API around, just like you can build one around reading
and updating fields.

Now, if this manual approach of "let the user build an API" is the best way to
handle the privacy of record fields, I don't know. But as I noted before, it
would be a solution that doesn't require another feature in the language. So it
may be the best place to start.
