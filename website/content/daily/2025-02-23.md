I'd like to conclude this long series on the new prototypes, by saying that I'm
fully aware that I'm setting myself up for some of the same problems that
[prototype 11] had. Then, I hadn't built a code database, despite considering
that a central feature. This led to a situation where all design decisions I
made where either [suboptimal or preliminary](/daily/2025-01-11).

I'm going to run into similar problems again, for example with the type system.
My plan is to have a static and linear type system, and yet I've decided to
[go with a dynamic one](/daily/2025-01-30) for now. I'm sure this will cause the
same kinds of problems that I had with the code database previously.

But it's going to cause those problems in an area that's less central to my
vision (although still very important). And I don't think that can be avoided. I
can't make everything perfect from day one, so I have to draw the line
somewhere. But I'll have to prioritize this soon. Even before other work, that
might have a more positive impact in the short term.
