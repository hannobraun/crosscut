I have laid out [two competing approaches](/daily/2025-04-20) to error handling:
One in the style of Rust, based on variant types and early returns in case of an
error; the other based on checked exceptions. Both approaches are
well-established in mainstream languages (Rust and Java, respectively).

If we look at error handling in isolation, both seem fine. But let's not forget,
the premise for this line of thought is that we
[no longer have linear types](/daily/2025-04-19), which means we need a
different solution for tracking side effects.

And as I see it, there are two competing approaches here too: Monads and
[algebraic effects](/daily/2024-12-10). This choice mirrors the one for error
handling, because a Rust-like `Result` type is a monad, while checked exceptions
are a subset of algebraic effects. It makes sense to consider both decisions
together.
