Okay, let's say we settle on `:` for prefix-style function application:

```
function: argument
```

And a pipe operator (`|>`) for postfix-style function application:

```
argument |> function
```

We'll have to see if it really ends up happening like that, but as of now, this
seems reasonable to me.

I think it's an interesting observation, that this would mean there's no
default. Both prefix and postfix require an explicit syntax. If you have
neither, then you're using the function [as a value](/daily/2025-05-22).
(Although one of them might become the default style in practice.)

Another interesting observation is that both `:` and `|>` are infix operators.
Something that I [didn't' want](/daily/2024-05-05) in the language. Let's dive
into that tomorrow.
