I have implemented [per-function code updates](/daily/2024-10-03). Kind of. It
doesn't _quite_ work yet.

This took some time, since I was doing a lot of cleanup in the compiler, to
prepare. But it paid off over the last few days. Code updates are implemented,
and all tests are passing.

But when I try to update a live instance of Snake, I'm running into bugs. No
idea what's wrong. And I've decided that the compiler needs more cleanup, before
it becomes worth looking into. The compiler has gotten a bit too complicated in
some places. And while the previous cleanup helped, it didn't rein in the mess
completely.
