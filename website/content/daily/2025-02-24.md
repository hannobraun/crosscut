It is hard to imagine what Crosscut would look like, if I hadn't followed the
approach of experimenting with [many prototypes][prototypes]. Most likely, I
would have given up on the project long ago (as I did on so many others). So I
think this prototype-based approach has been a success. I would totally use it
again on future projects.

At the same time, there's a psychological element that makes this approach
difficult. I know, rationally, that these prototypes have advanced the concepts
behind Crosscut, and have saved me from going down various dead ends. But, at
times, it can _feel_ like I've been going in circles without moving any closer
to the goal.

If I ended up abandoning the current prototype, that would be progress. Because
it would mean that I had discovered and prevented another outcome that wasn't
viable. And that would be good. But at the same time, I really hope it doesn't
come to that. That the current prototype finally is the real thing, and
everything that comes now can unequivocally feel like real progress.
