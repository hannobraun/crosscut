While I expect to build the next editor
[with web technologies](/daily/2025-04-05), I've also been flirting with the
idea of building the whole thing from the ground up, based on [wgpu] and
[glyphon]. While that is certainly going to require more of an investment, it is
more flexible and would also provide wide platform support.

And despite the additional work, I don't actually think it would be more trouble
than dealing with the mess that is modern HTML and CSS. At least once I reach
the point where I need custom user interface elements with sophisticated layout
requirements.

But the larger investment still poses a risk. And I have no idea what to do
about accessibility in that case, which is a topic I know very little about.
