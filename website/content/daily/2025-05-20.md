That's it. I went through the whole [list of reasons](/daily/2025-05-07) for
switching to prefix syntax. And at the very least, I thoroughly convinced myself
that it was the right decision. I think that with the benefit of hindsight, it's
pretty clear that postfix syntax died the moment I switched away from a
stack-based evaluation model. Those two only make sense together.

And, as if to demonstrate how overdue this change was, switching to prefix
syntax was quite easy. Most of the work took place in the test suite. Anything
else barely required any modifications. The evaluation model was already
tailor-made for prefix syntax.

I'm still convinced that there is room for _some_ postfix syntax in the
language, eventually. Look at `.method()` syntax and pipe operators in many
languages. Look at the `?` operator in Rust, and `.await`. It simply makes
sense, sometimes. But not as the default. Not in a language that isn't
stack-based.
