Okay, so at some point, we'll have a [short and sweet](/daily/2025-05-22) syntax
for (prefix) function application, that gets represented in the syntax tree as
an ["apply" node](/daily/2025-05-21). We could also have an equivalent syntax
for postfix function application, which compiles to the same syntax node. Maybe
using some kind of pipe operator:

```
argument |> function
```

Or maybe we take inspiration from what _many_ other languages do, and use `.`:

```
argument.function
```

I'm not sure about that last one though. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
