If we use functions to [access record fields](/daily/2025-06-09), that raises
some questions. Like, where do those functions come from? How do we get access
to them from the scope, where we use the record from? And that's what I meant
yesterday, when I said this topic is connected to other areas of the language.

I don't think that I've even talked much about functions so far. I mention them
all the time, of course, and I had a [series](/daily/2024-07-24) about control
flow almost a year ago, that goes into their structure. But I don't know how
much of that is still relevant; and either way, I don't think I ever really
worked out how they fit with the module system, or how name resolution works.

So let's get into that. I do have thoughts, and I do have notes. I guess now is
the perfect time to consolidate those into something more clear and coherent.
