I [said earlier](/daily/2025-03-19), that different branches could evaluate to
different types, and that those types could then be bundled into a variant.
Let's take an `if` expression as an example. If its "then" and "else" branches
evaluate to different types (let's say `A` and `B`), then the whole `if`
expression could evaluate to `variant { A, B }`.

What if they evaluate to the same type `X` though? This would imply that the
whole `if` evaluates to `variant { X, X }`, instead of just `X`, like we'd
expect. And I think this example motivates another aspect of
[normalizing variant types](/daily/2025-03-27): deduplication.

A `variant { X, X }` makes no sense, since there's no way to distinguish between
those cases. So it would normalize to a `variant { X }`. Which could then be
further normalized to just `X`. (Assuming [automatic lifting](/daily/2025-03-22)
is going to be a thing, that last step wouldn't make a difference anyway,
semantically.)
