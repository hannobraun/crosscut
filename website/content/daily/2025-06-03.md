If game development is [more than a stepping stone](/daily/2025-06-02) for
Crosscut, not just something that I move on from once I think that the project
is ready to start attracting real users, then I have to consider how to market
Crosscut to game developers. And I figure the best way to do that, is to write
actual games with it.

It would probably be ideal, if somebody else wrote those games. Somebody who
sees the potential in Crosscut and is willing to invest heavily into using it.
Somebody who works closely with me, so their experience can make Crosscut
better. But I think it would be a flawed plan, to expect this user to just show
up.

I'd rather have a plan that's still likely to work, even if I'm _not_ lucky.
Which means it's not an option to wait around. I have to _become_ that user. I
have to write those games myself.
