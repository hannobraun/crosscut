I decided to make (and have started working on)
[two big changes](/daily/2025-04-23):

- Switch the language from postfix syntax back to prefix syntax. (Already
  implemented!)
- Revamp the approach to structural code editing, making it more restricted and
  less free-form. (Still working on that one.)

The switch to prefix syntax might seem like the more impactful change, as the
language has been using postfix syntax since the beginning (though interrupted
by a few weeks of prefix syntax). While the new approach to structural code
editing might seem like more of a refinement of what I did before.

But I've actually come think of restricted structural code editing as the bigger
change. I'll go into both in due time, but I'll start there. Structural editing
is also going to provide some additional background on why I decided to make the
decision to switch up the language's syntax.
