I think that I've come up with a design for data types that is
[simple, orthogonal, and composable](/daily/2025-02-28). Let's get into it,
starting with records:

```
record { value: Integer, unit: Text }
```

A record has multiple fields, each of which has a name and a type. It's a
composite (or compound) data type, meaning it's a single value that bundles
multiple other values together. This kind of thing is often called "struct",
"class", or "object" in various languages. In terms of programming language
theory, this is called a product type.

I like the name "record" (inspired by [Pascal]), because it's easy to
understand, and doesn't seem to come with a lot of baggage. "Class" or "object"
come from the object-oriented world, which would be misleading. "Struct" would
be familiar to many, but as a name it seems overly broad. (Many data types could
be "structures", I think?)

Records are (by default; I'll expand on that later)
[structurally typed](/daily/2025-02-25) and anonymous. You could assign a name
to a record by returning it [from a module](/daily/2025-03-02), for example, and
refer to that name from elsewhere. Or you could define a record directly in
those places, anonymously.
