An early lesson I learned while working on Crosscut, is that making a
programming language is easy. It's just very, very hard, to then turn it into
something that you can use productively.

Maybe the central problem of programming, is to understand what's going on. What
your code is doing. Without the kind of infrastructure that a mature programming
language brings to the table, this can be difficult. Add to that, that earlier
prototypes used a pure concatenative model; no variables, unlimited access to
the stack; and the problem became _very_ challenging.

My answer to that, was to add a debugger. And not as an afterthought; I started
a new prototype with one built in from the beginning. Overall, this has been a
success. It solved the problem. It allowed me to actually work with my immature,
unwieldy language. But [nothing's perfect](/daily/2025-01-10), of course, and
the debugger has also been a source of problems.
