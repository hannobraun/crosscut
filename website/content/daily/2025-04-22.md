Right now, I'm looking at [two options](/daily/2025-04-21), each of which could
be used both for error handling and for tracking side effects: One are monads,
the other one [algebraic effects](/daily/2024-12-10).

I've been talking about [innovation tokens] recently. I only have so much
bandwidth, and too much innovation could also harm adoption. But I actually
think that in this case, both options are a somewhat safe bet. While algebraic
effects are much newer, they seem pretty established by now, in languages like
[Koka], [Unison], and [OCaml].

And at this point, I definitely prefer algebraic effects. They enable a much
more lightweight syntax that is also familiar to those that are not used to
functional programming. And they are more powerful, enabling features like
[async/await] without dedicated language support.
