[Normalizing record types](/daily/2025-03-26) is pretty straight-forward.
There's a bit more to variant types though. I can think of at least three
aspects that need to be considered when normalizing those.

The first one is similar to what's required for record types: Sorting the cases
of the variant, for example alphabetically. Because if a function expects a
`variant { A, B }`, and what you have is a `variant { B, A }`, there's really no
reason why that shouldn't just work; same way it would for records.

Tomorrow, let's continue with more aspects of normalization that are exclusive
to variant types.
