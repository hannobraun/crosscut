I showed you [a clear-cut example](/daily/2025-02-12) that demonstrates a
difference between prefix and postfix syntax. But of course, reality is more
messy than that.

That difference is less clear-cut, if we consider bindings (also called
variables). With those, yesterday's prefix code can be written like this:

```
let a = first_do_this();
let b = then_this(a);
finally_this(b)
```

Now the code reads naturally in order of execution, just like the postfix code.
Depdending on the specifics, naming the intermediate values could even increase
readability. Or it might not. In case it doesn't, many languages offer a pipe
operator:

```
first_do_this |> then_this |> finally_this
```

With this, we can write postfix-like code in a prefix-by-default language, using
a special operator. It's a little bit more noisy than an actual postfix
language, but maybe that's fine.

And while we could argue that these techniques just offset a natural
disadvantage of prefix syntax, there is also at least one aspect where prefix
syntax is genuinely better. Let's talk about that tomorrow.
