Okay, enough discussion about syntax! Let's take a closer look at the evaluation
model. Consider this expression:

```
```

It's empty! And yet, this is still an expression. One that does nothing. It
takes a value as input, and returns the same value as output.

It is equivalent to this one:

```
identity
```

This expression consists of an application of the `identity` function which,
just like the previous empty expression, takes a value as input, and returns the
same value as output.

And this input and output are implicit. The input flows through the expression,
being transformed, thereby turning into the output. To make that a bit easier to
talk about, we say that at every point in the expression, there's an _active
value_.

What this active value is, depends on the context. If this is the root context
of the program, in the current implementation, then the active value starts out
as `nothing`, which is the single instance of the type `Nothing`. And after the
application of `identity`, it's still `nothing`, because that's what the
`identity` function does to it.
