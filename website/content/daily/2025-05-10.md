As I was working on [yesterday's note](/daily/2025-05-09), I realized that there
are other ways to format a tree of expressions using postfix syntax. I could
also indent the children instead of the parent:

```
    argument
function
```

Maybe that would have been better? Or maybe not. I'm no longer interested in
exploring these kinds of questions.

But this demonstrates another [point I made](/daily/2025-05-07): That switching
to prefix syntax puts us into well-explored territory. While working on a
language with postfix syntax that uses a different evaluation model than all
other postfix languages (as far as I can tell) constantly requires these
micro-decisions. Right now, there are better areas to invest my effort in.
