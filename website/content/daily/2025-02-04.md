It's done! I went through [all the problems](/daily/2025-01-10) of the previous
prototypes. As promised, it took weeks. I also explained how I want to address
most of them in the new prototype, except for
[syntax and evaluation model](/daily/2025-01-25). Those will be the next topic.
But first, I have some news. I've started another new prototype! (A bit over a
week ago already.)

This latest prototype is closely based on the "new" one, and everything I've
been saying about the "new" prototype also applies to the latest one. So I hope
the confusion will be somewhat limited. The only difference is the
aforementioned syntax and evaluation model, which I plan to start explaining
tomorrow. (I have now [archived the old prototype][prototype 11], by the way.)

I think that after such a long period of stability (working on a single
prototype), this kind of churn is pretty normal. At least it was the same after
I concluded the [first long-running prototype][prototype 07]. A new approach
brings new ideas. And pretty quickly, some of those turn out to be undesirable,
for one reason or another.
