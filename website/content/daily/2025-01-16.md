The idea of immediacy, that you make a change and see the result in your program
without delay, that's the central premise Crosscut. This is expressed as
interactive programming. And yet, I started the previous prototype without that
feature. Based on experiences in an even earlier prototype, I had considered
that a solved problem, to the limited extend that it had been relevant so far.

And [that was a mistake](/daily/2025-01-10). I implemented interactive
programming later, as an afterthought, and it ended up not working very well. It
was missing the features required to make it work well with the language that
had developed up to that point. And on top of that, the earlier prototyping had
been more limited than I had realized, which caused problems of its own.

Such a central feature must be there from the beginning. Everything else that is
being added, needs to adapt to it. Then I can keep it working all the way
through, as the language grows around it. The [new prototype](/daily/2025-01-08)
is starting out with exactly that premise.
