Yesterday, I [introduced currying](/daily/2025-02-09) (or to be precise,
_automatic_ currying). I don't think this would work with postfix syntax. At
least I don't see how. We need something different for Crosscut.

And that _something_ are composite types. If you want to pass multiple values to
a function, you just bundle those up. If a function's parameters don't really
need explicit names, that composite value could be a tuple (e.g. `(1, 2) +`). If
you think naming them is beneficial, you can make that a record (e.g.
`{ a: 1, b: 2 } +`).

I like the elegance of this approach. Parameter lists of functions are not a
special syntax. It's just a tuple or record pattern. You don't need a special
feature for "keyword arguments", or something like that. Support for them just
arises from this concept naturally, as long as you support records. Plus, the
whole approach works for output values too (unlike currying).
