Short update, before I continue with the series on the syntax and evaluation
model: The "latest" prototype has surpassed the "new" one by now, in
functionality and overall maturity. And since I'm pretty much committed on the
new syntax and evaluation model (which I'll introduce tomorrow), I've decided
it's time to [archive the "new" prototype][prototype 12].

This means the "latest" prototype is now just the "current" or "active"
prototype, and I can refer to all other prototypes by their number
[in the archive][archive]. Hopefully this is the end to any potential confusion
around this topic ðŸ˜„

Since there's only one active prototype again, I've started turning some of my
local notes into [issues]. (All the previous issues were closed, since they
applied to [prototype 11].) I hope this will contribute to providing a better
overview over the current status again, going forward.

[prototype 11]: https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes/11
[prototype 12]: https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes/12
