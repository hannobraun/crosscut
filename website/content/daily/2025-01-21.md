Let's move on to the next two
[problems of the previous prototype](/daily/2025-01-10). I'm going to tackle
syntax and evaluation model together, since they are closely related.

From the start of the project, I was going for a syntax based on postfix
operators, and a stack-based evaluation model. I
[wrote about this decision](/daily/2024-05-03) before. Going through these old
notes (from 8 months ago!), I still largely agree with the points I made then.
(Although I have new thoughts, which I hope to get into at a later date.)

But despite all attractive qualities, this approach caused two major problems.
First, what I was trying to build was very different from anything that exists
(as far as I know). This turned every hurdle into a major design challenge.
Second, this model, despite its simplicity, is quite powerful. Which is nice.
But that power came back to bite me later, when working on the type system.
