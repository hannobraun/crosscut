I have built my life around working on big and ambitious project. Projects that,
so far, never got finished, but that still consume all of my potential. To the
detriment of ever doing much that is useful, for others or for myself.

I don't think the reason for that is too much incompetence on my part. I'm
certainly no genius, but I'm probably not that much dumber than most people who
live more successful lives. No, I think it's just the nature of what I'm doing.
If you work too far outside of your current capabilities (which is what big and
ambitious projects require), you are likely to fail. Simple as that.

I realize that my [decision to quit this project](/daily/2025-06-26) might seem
sudden. But I've been thinking and journaling about this for near two weeks now.
I don't like to make these kinds of decisions too quickly. But I'm also not the
type to burn myself out, trying to hold on to something that's already gone.
