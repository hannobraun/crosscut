It [can make sense](/daily/2025-03-12) to make the fields of a
[nominally typed record](/daily/2025-03-11) private. (Let's ignore variants for
now. That's a topic for another day.) I initially thought, that all nominal
types should be private by default. I even considered (and that's still not off
the table) to call the `nominal` keyword `opaque` because of that.

Making `nominal`/`opaque` have this double meaning would not be very
[orthogonal](/daily/2025-02-28), but that might be a worthwhile trade-off. It
would avoid having field visibility as a separate feature. Fields that should be
accessible, can be made so by adding a function that makes them so. It would
make the overall system much simpler.

Such a design would also set a tone. It could encourage safe abstractions, as
opposed to APIs whose correct operation is the user's responsibility. I'm all
for that, but I can also see how it could backfire. There is such a thing as
_too much_ abstraction. Then again, maybe I don't need to worry about that, if
structural types and public fields are the much more accessible default.
