One thing that came out of the recent compiler cleanup, is that function calls
(as represented in the compiler's intermediate representation) now refer to the
called function by hash. Previously, calls still referred to the callee by name.

This approach is inspired by [Unison]. I've
[talked about that before](/daily/2024-08-01). Caterpillar, at this point,
doesn't make use of any of the possibilities this brings yet. All calls are just
updated immediately, when the called function changes.

So at this point, this is just another building block on the way towards
eventually having a [code database](/daily/2024-07-29). It's something I would
really like to prioritize at some point. But for now, there's too much else to
do.
