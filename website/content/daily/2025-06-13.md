This series of notes [started with](/daily/2025-06-09) "How do we access record
field? Maybe use functions." and [went on to](/daily/2025-06-11) "How do
functions even work?". Now my latest drafts, which are currently a few days
ahead of what I already published, are getting into "How does type inference
interact with traits?", which is pretty far of from where I started.

I think it's time to take a step back, recognize that I'm in for more than I
bargained for, and reconsider how to continue. But this endeavor has been useful
in one respect: If I had to implement records soon, I now know that I would just
introduce special syntax for that. It's a good-enough placeholder, and anything
else would be too complicated for now.

With that out of the way, I'm not sure what to do. Maybe dive head-first into
Pandora's box and attack some of those gnarly questions that have started to
claw their way out. Or maybe go with an easier topic first, while I think some
more about those questions in the background. I guess we'll see tomorrow!
