Yesterday, I dropped a lot of [jargon and ideas](/daily/2025-06-14) all at once.
Let's slow down a bit and go through all that again, step by step, using Rust as
an example. First, we're going to define a trait:

```rust
trait Format {
    fn format(self) -> String;
}
```

What's happening here, is that we define a trait (which we call `Format`). A
trait is just a way to talk about types abstractly. Here we say that for any
type that implements this trait, a function called `format` must exist, which
takes a value of that type and returns a `String`.

With this definition in place, we can now write a function that uses it:

```rust
fn my_fn(value: impl Format) -> String {
    format!(
        "I have a value here that looks like this: {}",
        value.format(),
    )
}
```

So here we have a function that accepts a value, and builds a new `String` And
because this function uses the `Format` trait we defined earlier, it accepts
_any_ type for which the `Format` trait is implemented.

Tomorrow, let's take a closer look at how this works in Rust, and how it could
also work differently.
