There's a [second big problem](/daily/2025-01-21) caused by my choice of syntax
and evaluation model in the previous prototype: Postfix syntax and the
stack-based evaluation model are quite simple (maybe deceptively so), but also
powerful. And that power came back to bite me.

This came as a surprise, because this model is so _easy_ to get started with.
Just parse from left to right. Tokens are separated by whitespace. (Throw in
some more advanced tokenization, once ready.) Same with evaluation: Start on the
left, execute what you encounter immediately, keep all values on a
straight-forward stack.

Under this model, expressions consume and produce an arbitrary number of values.
With prefix syntax, that's not the case. There, every expression is a tree. A
sub-expression's output goes into one specific place. But with the stack-based
model, an expression could produce values, which could get consumed by multiple
expressions, which then might feed into a single expression. They form a graph.
