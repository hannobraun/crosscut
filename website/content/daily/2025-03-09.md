Yesterday, I showed how records and variants
[can be combined](/daily/2025-03-08). All the code I've shown there, were
examples of anonymous usage. But as I've alluded to before, we can also assign
names to types.

```
Id := variant { Integer, Text }
Address := record { street: Text, house_number: Integer }

record { id: Id, address: Address }
```

I'm using the `:=` syntax here as a shorthand for "a name was assigned
_somehow_" (for example via a [module](/daily/2025-03-02)). Please don't take it
too seriously.

Just assigning a name doesn't make a type [nominally typed](/daily/2025-02-26).
It just creates a _type alias_ (like `type` works in Rust). But named or not,
any type I've mentioned today or yesterday would still be
[structurally typed](/daily/2025-02-25).

While I believe that nominal typing is very valuable (and the language will
support it), I'm convinced that structural typing is a better default.
Explaining why I think that would go a bit too far right now, but I'm sure that
will be the topic of many daily notes in the future.
