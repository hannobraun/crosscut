It's finally time to talk about why I chose to switch from postfix to prefix
syntax. I have a whole list of reasons, but before I get into those, I need to
clarify something: We will have both prefix and postfix elements eventually,
like lots of languages do. But that is in the future. What I need right now, is
something good enough to allow me to make progress in other areas.

Because even if I was willing to spend a lot of time on syntax right now, I
couldn't come up with a truly good design. That requires iteration based on
feedback from real-world use. And I can't enable that real-world use, without
getting other areas sorted first.

So right now, the language requires a certain purity that it won't have
long-term. I need an easy starting point that works reasonably well. And I've
determined that postfix syntax is not that. Tomorrow, let's get an overview on
why I think that is the case.
