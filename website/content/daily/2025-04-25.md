In imperative languages, side effects are implicit. You call a function, and at
the call site, you won't see what it can do. It could be anything! That (very
deliberately) is not the case in purely functional languages, which track side
effects explicitly. And traditionally, they do that using values.

The classic approach to that is monads (in languages like [Haskell]). I was
considering a different approach based on [linear types](/daily/2024-07-09). But
it comes down to the same thing: If a function does something, then that
"something" is reflected in the values it accepts and returns.

As a natural result, statements (which are a mainstay in imperative languages)
are deemphasized or do not exist at all. Since every operation exchanges values
with others, all operations within a function body tend to end up as part of a
single expression.
