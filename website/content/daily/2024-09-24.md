Writing [yesterday's note](/daily/2024-09-23) on how having a code database
affects changes to syntax, I had a realization. Not a completely new one, but
some puzzle pieces that I had been thinking about separately suddenly snapped
together in my mind: If code shown to the developer is just a rendering of an
underlying representation, we're basically halfway to visual programming.

Now, visual programming as it's commonly understood, combining graphical boxes
that represent pieces of code, is something I'm very skeptical of. I've never
used an implementation that I actually liked. Then again, my exposure to it has
been very limited, and was basically non-existent in the last decade or so.

I guess that's a gap in my education that I should try and fill. But either way,
I think it's reasonable to imagine a middle ground. Code as text, yes, but maybe
formatting it with more than just whitespace. Maybe _do_ draw a box around
something here or there, to show the relationships between those words in the
code a bit better.
