Just like there are features that can
[offset the disadvantages of prefix syntax](/daily/2025-02-13), we can
[do the same for postfix syntax](/daily/2025-02-15). It has become clear to me,
that purism won't serve us in this case. We need both prefix and postfix
elements in the syntax. (Like [many other languages](/daily/2024-05-03).)

So the choice is not between one or the other. It's what the default should be:
Prefix syntax with an optional pipe operator? Or postfix syntax with an optional
prefix form?

Despite everything I've said in favor of postfix syntax, I don't know what the
eventual solution is going to be. I'm currently betting on postfix syntax by
default, but that could change again. With the current prototype, I'm
discovering that a code database and a structured editor shake things up in
unintuitive ways. I'm sure there's lots more to learn.
