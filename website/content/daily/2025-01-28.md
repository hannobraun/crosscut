What kind of type system am I going to implement in the new prototype? The end
goal is to have a static type system with full type inference. But that has
[proven to be impractical](/daily/2025-01-26) for the time being; so I have to
start with something else and transition later. And as far as I can tell, I have
the following options:

- Follow the lead of the previous few prototypes and start without a type
  system, making the language untyped.
- Start with a simple static type system, with explicit type annotations.
- Start with a dynamic type system.

Making the language untyped was, in some ways, a big success. It was very easy
to do and enabled me to build a somewhat complete game in the language. This in
turn allowed me to figure out a lot of other things. But that approach turned
out to be incompatible with reliable live code updates, making it a non-starter.
The choice is between static types with type annotations, or dynamic types.
