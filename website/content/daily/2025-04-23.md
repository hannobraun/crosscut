I'd like to interrupt the current musings for a short announcement: Two days
ago, I archived a snapshot of the current code as [prototype 13].

This isn't the same as starting a new prototype from scratch, as I'm going to
continue development based on the current state. But I have some work planned,
that is going to change the language and editor significantly. And before I make
these kinds of radical changes, I like to archive an easily accessible copy of
the previous state, for future reference.

What I'm going to do, is revamp the approach to structural code editing and
change the language from postfix syntax back to prefix. I'll go into more detail
right here, over the next few weeks. First, though, I'll continue talking about
algebraic effects for a bit, as that's going to provide some background to
support my decisions.
