I think it's important to consider the defaults we are setting, and what those
defaults are going to mean for how the language will be used. (I
[alluded to that](/daily/2025-03-13) before.) And I think I want Crosscut to be
a language that _allows_ you to build airtight abstractions where that makes
sense, but that doesn't _push_ you into doing that.

Having `nominal` and `opaque` as [separate concepts](/daily/2025-03-17) might be
the best option in that regard. Each would be available to you, as a tool in
your toolbox, but they wouldn't impose on you. You wouldn't feel forced to make
every API restrictive from the start, doing more harm than good.

The natural way of doing things would be all structural, all public. Which might
lead to a rather relaxed style of building APIs, where everything goes. But
where it makes sense, you can reach for specialized tools to tie things down.
Who knows if this is how it'll actually be; but I like the thought.
