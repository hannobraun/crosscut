Despite coming from the sensible wish
[to publish what I create](/daily/2025-01-31) with Crosscut, I believe that
completely centering the previous prototype
[around the browser](/daily/2025-02-01) was a mistake. The burden this caused
was unnecessary, for two reasons: It was too early, and there would have been an
easier way to do it.

I was able to write a simple game in a single big push, but the project was not
in a state where it could support me in creating more. The game's code was
horrible, and my focus turned to the language itself. Improving it to the point,
where using it for such a game would make actual sense. That process was weighed
down by a capability, publishing to the web, that was barely being used yet.

And that whole complexity was redundant in the first place. Because I didn't
need to center everything around the browser. I could have kept all the
interconnected, interactive infrastructure in a single process, outside of the
browser. And just support _exporting_ a browser version of the game, as a static
HTML page, with no connected debugger or live update capabilities.
