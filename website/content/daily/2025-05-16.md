So you call a bunch of functions, and the values that flow through them form a
[non-trivial graph](/daily/2025-05-15). Probably the most straight-forward way
to express that, is to assign names to those values, so you can refer to them
exactly where they are needed:

```rust
let (x, y) = a();
let z = b(x);
c(y, z);
```

Simple, easy to understand, tried and true. But note that this example is in
prefix syntax (it's Rust, to be precise). And yet, the operations are in the
order that they're going to get executed in. In that case, what exactly would be
the point of using postfix syntax instead?
