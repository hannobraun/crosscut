I've [laid out](/daily/2025-06-18) how almost all the variation of traits,
nominal or structural and named or anonymous, can be useful. So why not provide
control over both of these axes?

A few months back, I laid out a type system where types are structural and
anonymous by default, but you can easily [assign a name](/daily/2025-03-09) or
[make them nominal](/daily/2025-03-11). I think traits would fit into this model
as well.

If that works out remains to be seen, but it's an interesting possibility.
