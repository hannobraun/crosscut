The browser-centric architecture of the previous prototype created
[an ongoing burden](/daily/2025-01-31) for me. But for the most part, it wasn't
the browser itself that caused that. Except for making the debugger UI a bit
more complicated than it strictly needed to be.

Yeah, I had to figure out how to compile to WebAssembly, but that's easy to do
with Rust. Even going with a purpose-built build tool and not using a binding
generator wasn't too big of a deal. The JavaScript glue code was mostly a
one-time investment, with little ongoing maintenance required. All those are
things that I could easily do again.

What caused a huge burden, was putting the browser into the center of the whole
architecture. The game ran there, the debugger ran there, live code updates were
applied there. And since the browser runs in a separate process, that required a
server; communication between that, the game, and the build tool; serialization
of data structures; and so on. Lots of complexity that wasn't actually required.
