Let's get right to the point: I'm quitting. I already came close last week,
feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of working on Crosscut, and pessimistic
about its outlook. I didn't do it then, because giving up on a long-term project
due to a temporary mood would be stupid. But I'm doing it now. Because that
mood, temporary as it was, brought something into focus that I can't ignore.

To work on something big and ambitious, I think you need a certain degree of
blind optimism. Informed optimism just won't do it, if the project is too big to
hold in your head all at once. So ambitious, that you can't even imagine all of
the steps you still have to take.

And that little crisis of confidence, it shattered my blind optimism.
Permanently, I believe. Because it reminded me that I have built my life around
working on big and ambitious projects, and that (so far) none ever worked out.
More importantly, it made me realize that while I've gotten much better at doing
them, maybe that was the wrong lesson to learn.
