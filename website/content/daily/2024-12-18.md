That was something, wasn't it? One big article on Friday, about
[the problems with ad-hoc effects in Rust](/daily/2024-12-12). Another big one
yesterday, on how
[an algebraic effect system could fix that](/daily/2024-12-17). And of course,
more in between, because these are my _daily_ notes, after all.

Whenever I show actual code, these notes tend to come out much longer. Hopefully
I can switch back to the usual three paragraphs a day now, at least for a while
üòÅ

Before I move on to address some issues with algebraic effects that are specific
to Caterpillar, I'd like to emphasize that I didn't invent any of this (except
for the specific syntax in my examples). I don't know who did, because I'm not
in the habit of reading papers (most likely to my detriment). If you want to see
a real-world implementation, check out "abilities" in [Unison].
