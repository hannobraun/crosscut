I'm not completely sure yet what's next for me. I mean, I still have
[my other big project](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot), of course, which
in contrast to Crosscut has some amount of ongoing funding.

I do know that my ambition to create a better way to write software, is still
well and alive. Along with my conviction that interactivity, immediacy, the
shortest possible feedback loops, are the way to achieve that. But I'm not going
to keep expressing that ambition by
[working on a huge project](/daily/2025-06-27) that might not work out. And even
if, probably won't see any success.

I'll have to figure out the details as I go. But I do know, whatever comes next,
and however much of Crosscut is in that, it will be a small, achievable project.
And so will the next one. Maybe my projects will grow again, over time. But only
once I've earned it. When I can build on previous steps that already work,
instead of having to jump right into the deep end, with little preparation.
