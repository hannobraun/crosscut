I'm interrupting the normal flow of notes for a quick update: Yesterday, I
finished implementing [restricted structural editing](/daily/2025-05-04). I went
down the wrong path there for a while, making the implementation too
complicated. Which is why it took a few weeks. But I found a better approach,
and it ended up being a rather simple change.

The current editing capabilities are extremely basic though. I reduced the
number of tests (which I think is a decent proxy for feature complexity) from
around 90 to less than 60. The result is not good enough for real-world use, but
definitely sufficient for making progress in other areas.

I will keep improving editing, as needed. But right now, my focus is on
implementing bindings. The lack of which blocks making sensible use of
recursion, which will in turn open up a whole new world of problems and
opportunities.
