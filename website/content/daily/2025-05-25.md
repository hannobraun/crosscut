The way many languages use the [`.` syntax](/daily/2025-05-24) for methods is
weird to me. It's not a general "postfix function application" syntax like
[pipe operators](/daily/2025-05-23) are. Instead, the first argument of the
method is considered special, and that's the only thing that's put before the
function:

```
arg1.function(arg2, arg3)
```

We end up with this weird between prefix and postfix syntax.

The first argument is not only syntactically special, but also semantically. It
is the only argument used for [dynamic dispatch] (that's called single
dispatch). There's also multiple dispatch, selecting a function (at runtime)
based on the type of multiple arguments. This is very prominent in [Julia], for
example.

I don't know what role multiple dispatch will play in Crosscut, but keeping my
options open here is another reason, in addition to the general weirdness, for
not going with this syntax. But I guess there's still something to learn here,
because this enables [fluent interfaces], which can be nice. I don't know what
to make of this yet, but I'm sure answers will reveal themselves in time.
