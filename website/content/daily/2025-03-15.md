Rust tracks which fields of a struct [have moved](/daily/2025-03-14). Crosscut
could do the same for its records, but would that actually be necessary? Having
thought about it some more, this whole notion of moving a value out of a field
(and moving one back in) only makes sense, if structs are mutable. In Crosscut,
records (and any other value) definitely wouldn't be.

So what would that look like, if a language with immutable values had a
[linear type system](/daily/2024-07-09)? Then moving a field out of a record
would create a new value, just like any other modification would. And in this
specific case, that new value would have a different type.

Let's say you have a record of type `record { a: A, b: B}`, and move the value
out of the `a` field. Then the updated record would be of type
`record { b: B }`. You could move another value of type `A` back in, to replace
the original one, and the result would be a `record { a: A, b: B }` again.
