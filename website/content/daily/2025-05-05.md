I haven't fully worked out [restricted structural editing](/daily/2025-05-04)
yet. And for now, I won't. I need real-world feedback to make it truly good. But
the system overall isn't ready for real-world use yet, so I can't get that
feedback. What I need now, are quick and easy solutions that allow me to make
progress, and that I can expand on later, once I have real-world feedback.

I'm trusting that once I run into limitations with the current approach to
restricted structural editing, there will be solutions to make things work.
That's the bet I'm taking with this. That these solutions are going to be
available. That I'm not working myself into a dead end.

As always, I'm optimistic that things will work out. Otherwise I wouldn't be
doing it. And as always, I might be wrong. I [have been](/daily/2025-02-05) in
the past! I'm just taking my best shot. If it doesn't land, I'll try something
else.
