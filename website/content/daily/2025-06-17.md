Let's imagine an alternative version of Rust, one where traits are
[structural instead of nominal](/daily/2025-06-16). So every type that matches
the definition of a given trait, could be used as an implementation of that
trait. We wouldn't need to mention that trait by name, in the implementation of
any type.

The only place where we would still need to mention the trait, is where we want
to use it. Like that function in my
[example from two days ago](/daily/2025-06-15). Here it is again:

```rust
fn my_fn(value: impl Format) -> String {
    // body omitted for brevity
}
```

And if that's the only place where we need to name the trait, then we could just
as well define it right there. The trait could be anonymous:

```rust
fn my_fn(value: impl trait { fn format(self) -> String; }) -> String {
    // body omitted for brevity
}
```

And again, that is not new. TypeScript allows that, for example, in the form of
[object types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html).
