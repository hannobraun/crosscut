I'd like to dive back into the type system for a bit, specifically
[variant types](/daily/2025-03-07) and how they interact with
[automatic lifting](/daily/2025-03-22). This design is very unconventional, and
I've realized (in a recent conversation with [Adrian Sieber]) that it can seem
arbitrary. So I'd like to present this concept from another perspective.

I hope that Crosscut can be a truly scalable language. Something you can use for
a quick-and-dirty prototype, extremely reliable production code, and anything in
between. And specifically, I want transitions between those different modes of
development to be practical. You should be able to write a quick hack to test
something, then refactor that into a solid solution that you can deploy.

One important aspect of this is error handling. You should be able to just
ignore any errors while prototyping. But when you're done with that, it should
be obvious _which_ errors could arise, and _where_ they need to be handled.
