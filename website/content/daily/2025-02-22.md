I'm still [focused on game development](/daily/2024-11-02) as an initial use
case for Crosscut. And so I'm building a minimalist game engine that uses
Crosscut as the programming language. Since a [custom editor](/daily/2025-01-15)
is part of that, this game engine comes in the form of a self-contained
application, as opposed to just a library.

But the first priority is not to make a great game engine. It's to create a
[tight, interactive core](/daily/2025-01-20) that provides an immediate
connection between you and your live program. This means that the interactive
editor with integrated debugging functionality, including less common features
like stepping back through your code, are most important right now.

Anything that doesn't directly support this interactive core, must wait. That
means I'll keep the language minimal, for the time being. It means platform
support of the game engine is limited. And once I get to the point where I want
to publish a game again, I'll implement that as an export to a static web page,
without interactive connection to the engine. The scope needs to stay small.
