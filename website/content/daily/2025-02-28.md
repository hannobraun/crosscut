As I said, I like designs that are simple, orthogonal, and composable. And
yesterday, I showed how [data types in Rust aren't that](/daily/2025-02-27);
because they mix up three different concepts:

- The structure of a type: Its memory layout; what it contains.
- The name that can be used to refer to a type.
- Whether the type is structural or nominal.

I believe that by keeping these concepts separate, we can create a design that
is easier to understand, because it is made up of simple elements that each do
one thing only. At the same time, such a design could be more powerful, if we
allow those elements to be composed.
