I previously showed you what [records](/daily/2025-03-05) could look like. Let's
continue today with another important building block, variants:

```
variant { Integer, Text }
```

A variant is a type that can be either of multiple values (for now, I'm calling
these "cases"). In this example, it could be either a value of type `Integer` or
`Text`. This is often called a "union" (which seems overly general, like it
could just as well apply to any composite type) or an "enum" (which seems overly
specific), or in programming language theory terms, a sum type.

Like records, variants are [structurally typed](/daily/2025-02-25) and anonymous
(by default; more on that later). They are also always tagged, which means that
what the case of a specific value is, is stored as part of that value. If you
encounter a value of the variant type from above, you could figure out what it
contains at runtime, via pattern matching.
