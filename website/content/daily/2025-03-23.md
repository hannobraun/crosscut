Most functional languages seem to use [monads] for error handling (and other
things). I think my approach centered around
[automatic lifting](/daily/2025-03-22) is just another formulation of that.

There would be a way to turn a value of type `A` into a `variant { A, ... }`.
That's basically the monadic `return` operation. And then `bind` is that thing
that the compiler automatically does as part of the lifting.

So I guess if my idea doesn't work out, doing it the normal way could be a
sensible fallback plan.
