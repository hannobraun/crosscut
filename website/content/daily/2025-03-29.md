There's one last aspect to normalizing variant types (in addition to
[sorting](/daily/2025-03-27) and [deduplication](/daily/2025-03-28)), that we'll
probably need in the language: flattening of nested variants. That would mean
that `variant { A, variant { B, C } }` would become `variant { A, B, C }`.

Assume we have a function `A -> variant { B, NetworkError }`, and follow that up
with another function `B -> variant { C, FileNotFound }`. Due to
[automatic lifting](/daily/2025-03-22), that would result in a
`variant { variant { C, FileNotFound }, NetworkError }`, which seems
unnecessarily complex. And consider, chaining more functions could make that
much worse.

I think the problem becomes more pronounced, if both functions return the same
error, for example resulting in
`variant { variant { C, FileNotFound }, FileNotFound }`. What even is that? If
we flatten it to `variant { C, FileNotFound, FileNotFound }`, we can then
deduplicate, resulting in `variant { C, FileNotFound }`. Much more reasonable!
