Let's take a closer look at the
[automatic application of functions to variant types](/daily/2025-03-21). If we
have a fallible function `f: A -> variant { B, Error }`, and we follow it up
with another function `g: B -> C`. The compiler could automatically wrap `g` in
another function it creates, `g': variant { B, Error } -> variant { C, Error }`.

If the variant happens to be `B`, this new function `g'` would just apply `g`
and wrap its result in another variant. If the variant is `Error`, `g'` would
return that unchanged. This is basically [railway-oriented programming], but
built into the language.

This whole concept is not new. I believe what I did above, turning `g` into `g'`
would be called ["lifting"]. But all the examples I could find in the wild
either do this explicitly, or as part of a special notation. Maybe I'm missing
something. But at least right now, I can't think of a reason why automatic
lifting wouldn't work.
