Since centering the previous prototype around the browser was
[so unnecessary](/daily/2025-02-02), I am taking the opposite approach for the
new one: radically simplify the whole architecture by running everything in a
single process, including both the game and the
[interactive editor](/daily/2025-01-15).

That comes with some disadvantages. Ease of access, for one. I'm not going to
provide a ready-made downloadable version, since that would be its own can of
worms and a huge distraction. So for the time being, the target platform is
basically an already installed Rust development environment. You can use
Crosscut by cloning the repository and executing `cargo run`.

Which limits me on the marketing side. Eventually, I want to have a live demo on
the website. So the development environment has to support the browser
eventually. But that's a problem for later. For now, this approach gives me some
breathing room to figure out all the things that need figuring, before something
like a live demo can even become relevant.
