Being [easy to implement](/daily/2025-01-29) is not the only advantage of a
dynamic type system. From the user's perspective, it might provide a smoother
transition to the eventual goal of a fully inferred static type system. Because
both provide a similar experience, at least superficially: You don't explicitly
specify any types.

Despite these advantages over an annotated static type system, it does present
more of a detour from an implementation point of view. But since yet again, I'm
in the process of falling ever deeper into the trap of "how hard could it be"
and being overly ambitious, maybe an easy detour is preferable to a straight
path that presents additional short-term difficulties.

[The main premise](/daily/2025-01-20) of the new prototype is a tight
interactive core. That means you'll usually deal with code that is currently
running. Meaning that even with a dynamic type system, the editor can often show
you what the type (even the value) of something is. I still think that a static
type system is preferable long-term, but I'll be going with a dynamic one for
now.
