I've come to believe that automatic lifting
[won't work in practice](/daily/2025-04-16). It definitely would for the simple
case: Imagine a `variant { A, B }` and two functions `f: A -> X` and
`g: B -> X`. Apply `f` and you end up with `variant { X, B }`. Apply `g` and you
get `variant { A, X }`. Easy.

But what about generic functions? If you have a function that takes a generic
type `T`, how do you apply it? To `A`? To `B`? To the whole variant? Unless
there is some constraint on `T` that only makes one of those options possible,
it's unclear.

The language could have rules for that, that favor one option over others. Or
require the user to always explicitly state what to do in such a case. It's not
an unsolvable problem. But automatic lifting is supposed to make things smooth
and easy. If it introduces a complication in this common case (which I expect
generic functions to be), then it defeats its own purpose.
