Earlier prototypes had dynamic type systems, and this is rather easy to do. In
the previous prototype, I had started to implement a static type system. And
while I never got the type inference fully working before I switched to the new
prototype, I think it would be practical to continue with explicit type
annotations. So both static and dynamic [are viable options](/daily/2025-01-28).

The eventual goal is to have a static type system with full type inference. From
an implementation perspective, a static type system with explicit annotations
has the advantage of providing a smoother transition to that, compared to a
dynamic type system. But it's not as easy to implement. Which could turn into a
distraction.

In the short term, I am much more confident in my ability to implement a dynamic
type system. And while I used to think that this would be a detour, I'm starting
to change my mind. Because while a static type system provides a smoother
transition to the eventual goal from an implementation perspective, a dynamic
type system might present a smoother transition for the user.
