Let's build on yesterday's example about [structural typing](/daily/2025-02-25).
If we don't want to repeat our type all the time, we can define it once and give
it a name:

```rust
type Measurement = (Value, Unit);

fn measure_width() -> Measurement { ... }
fn measure_height() -> Measurement { ... }
```

The return type is no longer anonymous. But that approach we used to give it a
name, the `type` declaration, doesn't change anything else. It's still
structural typing. Let me demonstrate:

```rust
type Width = (Value, Unit);
type Height = (Value, Unit);

fn measure_width() -> Width { ... }
fn measure_height() -> Height { ... }
```

Now the two function's return types have different names. But they're still the
same type. We can assign both return values to the same variable, as we did
yesterday. Because they still have the same structure. Tuples in Rust are
structurally typed, and `type` doesn't change that. It's just a _type alias_.

Let's try something different:

```rust
struct Width(Value, Unit);
struct Height(Value, Unit);

fn measure_width() -> Width { ... }
fn measure_height() -> Height { ... }
```

Now we're no longer using tuples, nor type aliases. Those are _tuple structs_.
And despite having the same structure, those two structs have different types.
This no longer works:

```rust
let width = measure_width();
let height = measure_height();

let max_dimension = if width > height {
	width
} else {
	height
};
```

It won't compile, because the compiler can't figure out what the type of
`max_dimension` should be. It can't be both `Width` or `Height`, because that's
a difference that matters now. They are different types, with different names,
defined in different locations; despite having the same structure. This is
called _nominal typing_.
