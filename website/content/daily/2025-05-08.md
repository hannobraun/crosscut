A consequence of structural code editing, is that code is auto-formatted.
There's really no choice about it, because you're not editing text that could be
manually formatted one way or the other. You're editing the syntax tree
directly, which contains no spaces, tabs, or newlines. And the editor needs to
decide how to format that.

At some point, I expect the auto-formatting logic to make good decisions in most
situations. But for now, I optimize for simplicity: Every single expression gets
a separate line, and children are indented. So a function call could look like
this:

```
function
	argument
```

(I'm saying _could_ look, because it actually looks a bit different right now.
But going into that would add extra complexity here, and not help get my point
across.)

Tomorrow, let's compare that to how it looked with postfix syntax, and what
[problems](/daily/2025-05-07) I encountered.
