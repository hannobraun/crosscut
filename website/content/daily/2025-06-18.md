Let's recap: Traits can be nominal or they can be
[structural](/daily/2025-06-16), and they can be named or they can be
[anonymous](/daily/2025-06-17). And there are good reason to choose either of
those options, except for the nonsensical combination of nominal/anonymous.

Structural traits are low-friction and flexible, but you risk using functions
whose signature happens to match, while the implementation is totally
unexpected. Nominal traits prevent that by requiring the trait implementation to
be intentional, at the cost of some traits not always being implemented where
they could be.

Anonymous traits are light-weight, which an be convenient in the right
situations. If traits can be both structural and anonymous, they can be fully
inferred by the compiler. You wouldn't have to specify any types, yet still get
full type checking. Such a statically typed language could feel as frictionless
as a dynamically typed one.
