Let's talk about abstraction! It's often very useful to describe a set of
functions that apply to some type which isn't mentioned explicitly, and then
write code that uses this set of functions to deal with _any_ type for which
these functions are defined. This goes by many names. Interface, trait, type
class, protocol, concept, behavior, and probably more.

I've talked about [structural](/daily/2025-02-25) and
[nominal](/daily/2025-02-26) typing before. And how I intend for types to be
anonymous and structural by default, with an easy way to assign a name and/or
[make them nominal](/daily/2025-03-11). I wonder if the same can apply here.

Initially, I thought that this idea was a bit wild. Turns out though, there's
prior art, and even in a mainstream language! [TypeScript] has object types that
are both anonymous and structural. Meaning you can define which functions you
expect to be available on a value, and if they are, it type-checks. No need to
assign a name to that type, or to implement it explicitly.
