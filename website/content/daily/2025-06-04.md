If Crosscut is to become a successful tool for developing games, then I need to
[develop games](/daily/2025-06-03) with it. To generate real-word experience
that makes Crosscut better, and to market it, to show that it is indeed a viable
tool.

At this point, this line of thought runs into a bit of a hurdle though. I
_can't_ develop games with Crosscut. It's not ready. And since I started the
latest round of prototypes in early January, development has progressed at a
glacial pace. Currently, it seems like it might take forever to support full
games, beyond maybe the most basic ones.

Which is fine. I [expected that](/daily/2025-01-17). But I'm still getting
antsy. I'm worried that I'm going to work forever on this one big thing, only
for it to fail at some point, for some reason, leaving me with little to show
for my efforts. How can I avoid this risk, without compromising on the project's
core vision? I have some thoughts, which I'm going to share tomorrow.
