So yeah, I'm starting to develop games, mostly in Rust, using Crosscut where I
can. Over the last week or so, I already laid out how I got to that decision.
But there's another line of though that kinda ran in parallel, which also swayed
me towards taking games as a use case for Crosscut more seriously.

A while ago, I started looking into some established game engines and
frameworks, just to get a better feel for what's out there. Until then, my frame
of reference for what a competitive game engine needs to be, was along the lines
of [Godot] or [Defold]. Making something comparable to those, would require a
lot.

But then I tried [LÖVE], which opened my eyes to the possibilities. Because it's
such a simple thing, and yet people make [very serious][Moonring] and
[very successful][Balatro] games with it. If there are developers who prefer
simple engines and produce such great games, then maybe I have a chance to serve
that market successfully.
