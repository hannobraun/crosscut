One thing that I'm still not clear on, is field visibility: How to control
whether a field of a [record](/daily/2025-03-05) (or a case of a
[variant](/daily/2025-03-07)?) is visible outside of the module where the record
or variant was defined.

Remember: By default, those types are [structurally typed](/daily/2025-02-25). I
think this also means that by default, all fields (and cases) must be public by
default. Because what would a private field of a structurally typed record even
mean? What would it be private to? You could always define your own version,
indistinguishable from any other. In that context, privacy makes no sense.

But if you [define a nominal type](/daily/2025-03-11), that equation changes.
Because now, you have a single instance of the type, and it often makes sense to
privilege the module where that instance was defined. That's how you can build
abstractions.
