I laid out a [list of questions](/daily/2025-06-11) about functions, which we
need answers for before we can get into how they relate to record fields. Let's
start with the first question, will Crosscut have methods?

I already [wrote about those](/daily/2025-05-25) recently. I think they're
weird. They create redundancy between methods and regular functions, with two
ways to do basically the same thing. I prefer simple designs made up of
orthogonal elements, and a function/method duality is definitely not that.

They might also be limiting, when it comes to the question of single dispatch
versus multiple dispatch (which I'll go into later). And why limit ourselves
without a strong reason? The thing is though, I might discover that strong
reason as I work through this. It wouldn't be the first time. But for now, let's
answer the question with a clear no: Crosscut will not have methods.
