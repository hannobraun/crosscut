So yeah, I'm currently trying to build a
[custom Vim-like editor](/daily/2025-01-14) for the code database. There's a
clear risk of going down a rabbit hole, at the expense of making any meaningful
progress. But I think it's worth the try.

Immediacy is the core theme of the whole project. And a custom editor that
modifies the code database directly, allows for the most immediate experience.
It would mean that we know _precisely_ which changes the developer made, and can
apply those to the running process without delay. With the
["checkout" model](/daily/2024-12-31), we could only update larger units of
code.

Maybe this will be a huge win. Maybe it won't work and I need to switch to the
checkout model. Or the code database as a whole is a dumb idea, and I'm going
down the wrong path entirely. Either way, the [new prototype](/daily/2025-01-08)
is here to answer those questions.
