Maybe I could work around
[the problem with automatic lifting](/daily/2025-04-17). Come up with some
solution that works well enough, and makes the whole thing worth it on balance.
But I think that would not be wise.

In a recent conversation, my unofficial language design consultant [Adrian]
reminded me about [innovation tokens]. I have not been spending mine wisely. I'm
basically in innovation debt. But only one innovation is truly important to the
project's goals: The interactive core that enables fine-grained hot reloading.

I think it's time to take a step back and return to more proven concepts in
other areas. Especially if it has become clear, that the unproven concept I was
considering does not deliver the clear advantage that I thought it would. As is
the case here. So as of now, I'm no longer considering to include automatic
lifting in Crosscut.
