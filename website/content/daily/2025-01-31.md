Let's move on to the last in the previous prototype's
[list of problems](/daily/2025-01-10): that it targets the browser as the
primary platform, which causes a lot of complexity. I've already
[alluded to this](/daily/2025-01-19) earlier.

I made this decision, because a former prototype had achieved the capability to
support actual games. I had written one (a Snake), and wanted the ability to
publish this game (and future ones) in a way that would allow people to easily
play it. Because if I can't actually publish stuff, nothing I'm building is of
any use.

But then I went on to not use that capability (even the Snake game went
unpublished for a good while), because I was busy with figuring out the language
design, compiler implementation, and other technical aspects. And despite not
being used, the browser-centric architecture introduced a lot of complexity that
translated into an ongoing burden.
