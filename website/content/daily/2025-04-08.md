While there are [seemingly good reasons](/daily/2025-04-07) for building the
next editor on top of a thin abstraction over the GPU, I still think the idea is
a bit far-fetched. It would require coming up with a custom UI framework, and
that would be a lot of work.

But whatever, that's a decision for another day. The good news is, the editor,
as it exists right now, is largely UI-agnostic. There's a thin layer of
terminal-specific code, built around an agnostic core that implements most of
the editor logic.

While there might be some assumptions about the terminal environment that have
made their way into this core, that overall setup should make porting the editor
to another environment pretty straight-forward. Even experimenting with multiple
editor interfaces in parallel should be practical.
