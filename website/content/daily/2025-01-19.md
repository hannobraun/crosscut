The debugger in the previous prototype, despite
[being a success](/daily/2025-01-18) overall, has
[created problems](/daily/2025-01-10). Keeping it updated was a constant drag on
resources, and it _still_ ended up being broken all the time; barely usable, due
to critical bugs.

A big part of that was due to mismanaged priorities, and I simply need to do
better. Another part is an inherent problem. A debugger is an additional
component. The added complexity is going to cause problems and require work to
manage. But I do believe that the debugger from the previous prototype was
_unnecessarily_ problematic, because it ran in the browser.

This caused problems in two ways, specifically: Running in the browser requires
a server (since the debugger needs to connect to other components that _don't_
run in the browser), which saddles the overall system with a lot of complexity
(more on that topic later). And rendering it with web technologies simply isn't
the easiest way to do it.
