The [incremental approach](/daily/2025-06-06) to using Crosscut for real games
has a lot of advantages. The project would get room to breathe. I wouldn't need
to hurry, to make Crosscut a viable language on its own. It could mature slowly,
which I'm sure would improve the outcome.

I think there's a risk though, of splitting my focus. To some degree, that can't
be avoided. Crosscut [_needs_ those games](/daily/2025-06-03) to be successful.
I'm convinced of that. But starting to work on them right now, and writing more
of their code in Rust, that's a bigger detour than doing pure Crosscut games at
some undefined point in the future.

It's a trade-off. And I think on balance, the advantages outweigh the
disadvantages. Maybe. Or maybe I'm letting my [antsiness](/daily/2025-06-04) get
the better of me. Staying laser-focused could be the superior play. As usual,
there's only one way to find out, and that's to make the choice and run with it.
