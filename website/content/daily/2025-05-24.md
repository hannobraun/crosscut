Pipe operators are a tried and true way to achieve
[ad-hoc postfix syntax](/daily/2025-05-23) where you want that. But they are not
common in languages with C-style/curly-brace syntax. There, `.` is pervasive.

However, `.` is not a general operator for postfix function application (at
least not anywhere I've seen). Instead, it tends to be used as a special syntax
for things that _only_ support postfix syntax (like accessing the fields of a
struct, or `.await` in Rust), or for method syntax (which deserves a dedicated
note; let's do that tomorrow).

These different usage patterns, plus the potential confusion with `.` in Haskell
(which is used for a similar purpose, but does function composition instead of
function application), makes me think that `.` is not a good choice for a
general "postfix function application" operator.
