Despite [the problems caused](/daily/2025-01-19) by the debugger in the previous
prototype, I'm committed to again starting the new prototype with this
capability present. I spoke about the
[importance of immediacy](/daily/2025-01-17) before, and I've come to believe
that this kind of tooling is an essential part of that.

But I don't intend to write a stand-alone debugger again. Instead, the
[custom editor](/daily/2025-01-15) is going to provide this functionality in one
unified interface. Together with the code database, this will form a tight
interactive core, that is going to provide the experience of immediacy that I'm
going for.

More and more, it's becoming clear to me, that this tight core is the main
premise of the new prototype.
