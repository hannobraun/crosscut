I've presented both [record](/daily/2025-03-05) and [variant](/daily/2025-03-07)
types. I want to expand on those and how they interact, to hopefully make things
a bit more clear.

Both records and variants are types, and they contain types. So naturally, you
should be able to combine them freely. Here's a record that contains a variant
and another record:

```
record {
    id: variant { Integer, Text },
    address: record { street: Text, house_number: Integer },
}
```

Here's a variant that could be either a record or another variant:

```
variant {
    record { street: Text, house_number: Integer },
    variant { Integer, Text },
}
```

And by the way, I've chosen the syntax here for clarity in these examples. It
might or might not be similar to what eventually ends up in the language.
