Crosscut is not ready for actual use, and it won't be for a while. This
[poses a risk](/daily/2025-06-04). If all goes well, I'll keep working on it for
a long time, until everything works out. But even that scenario is not going to
be smooth sailing. Success would mean having only a first draft, one that's
never been faced with real-world use.

And failure would mean wasting years of my life, with little to show for it. So
I wonder, how can I derisk this situation? Can I pull some of that future
success into the present, so I can have smaller pay-offs as I go? Even if that
slows things down a bit, that would be worth it. And that's where
[developing games](/daily/2025-06-03) enters the picture.

If I could start doing that right now, somehow, then at least I'd finish some
side projects along the way. I would improve the final product, by gaining
real-world experience throughout the process. And maybe those games could even
contribute to funding Crosscut's development. (Yes, seems unlikely. It's a hard
business. But still, it's possible.)
