[I see problems](/daily/2025-04-11) with error handling in Rust, and I'd like to
improve on those with Crosscut. Less boilerplate code would be great. But more
importantly, I want to make it obvious _which_ errors can occur in a given
program, and _where_.

This means, if I look at the `main` function of my program, I want its signature
to show me all of the errors that could arise in the whole program. If I look at
any function that's applied within the `main` function, I want to see which
errors could originate from that function specifically. And so on, recursively.

This means that if a function can return an error, that specific error would
need to show up in its signature. If a function called multiple others that
return various errors, the union of all these errors would need to be visible in
that function's signature. Tomorrow, I'd like to present a straight-forward way
to achieve this, that might or might not fit the constraints of Crosscut.
