Okay, so protocols can be expressed [as generic modules](/daily/2025-06-24). But
you know what, having modules with parameters, doesn't that pretty much sound
like functions? Functions that run at compile-time, and can only take arguments
that are known at compile-time? Like types or constants.

This is the kind of thing that excites me about programming language design.
When it turns out you can express concepts that seem distinct at first using the
same basic building blocks, simplifying the system as a whole.

And while I'm not aware of a _compiled_ language that actually does this, the
idea of modules being functions is not new either. It was pretty common (at
least that's how it seemed to me) to do that in old-school JavaScript, for
example, before it grew a dedicated module system.
