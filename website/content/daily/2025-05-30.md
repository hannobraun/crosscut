Before I move on to the next topic, it's time for another development update!

I've updated the root context and function bodies to be a
[series of expressions](/daily/2025-04-27) instead of just a single expression.
One small step in the direction of algebraic effects. I also managed to write
the first recursive function that actually does something! Here's a video:

This function sets the background color of the window, sleeps for 20
milliseconds, then calls itself recursively with a slightly lighter background
color. As you can see, typing even such simple code is pretty tedious right now.
But one thing at a time. (No idea why the editor starts to flicker at some
point. I'll look into it.)

The next priority is to implement live updates, or hot reloading, or whatever
the nomenclature will end up being. With recursive functions being practical
now, this actually becomes possible to test. Whereas before, the current "reset
after change" behavior wasn't actually distinguishable from true live updates.
