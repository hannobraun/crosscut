I'm not writing these daily notes because I expect people to read them. Maybe
that will change at some point. Once Crosscut has found a user base, I'll
probably end up posting more things here that are intended to help those users,
and less about ideas for its future development. But we'll see how that turns
out.

In the meantime (and I've said this before), I have a different reason for
writing daily: It helps me think. And the recent
[detour into modules](/daily/2025-03-01) has been a great example of that.

When I started, I only had vague ideas about how modules could work. Now that
I've written down the core of this fuzzy concept, I've already identified parts
of it that won't work, developed ideas on how to address that, and wrote all of
that down. Over time I'll expand those notes, until they turn into a series of
notes I post here. Which will then provide even more clarity.
