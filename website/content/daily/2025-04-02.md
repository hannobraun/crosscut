Progress [has been slow](/daily/2025-04-01), but I still made _some_. To remind
you, the goal for the current milestone is to build a minimalist game engine.
But so far, all you can do is set the background color in the game window (and
that only in grayscale). Here's a screencast of me playing around with the
editor:

First, I'm just typing numbers. If the program evaluates to a number, the game
engine interprets that as a grayscale value and uses it as the background color.
Then, I'm writing functions. If the program evaluates to a function value, the
game engine executes that, passing it a "display" value. The `black` and `white`
functions operate on the display, setting the color accordingly.

All that is pretty limited. The language can do _a bit_ more, but not much. The
background color updates directly, in response to what you type, but that is a
bit fake. So far, the whole program restarts on every change. It's not a live
update of the running program, which is what I'm eventually going for.
