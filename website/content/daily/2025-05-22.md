Function application is [quite verbose](/daily/2025-05-21) right now. At some
point, I'd like to have a more concise syntax that is both easier to read and to
write. Maybe something like this:

```
function:
	argument
```

The `:` would tell the compiler that you want to apply `function` to `argument`.
If you wrote `function` without the `:` after it, you would be referring to the
function as a value, maybe to pass it to another function:

```
higher_order_function:
	function
```

I like this so far. It's clean and simple. And it meshes well with
[restricted structural editing](/daily/2025-05-04): If you type `:`, the
compiler knows to create a placeholder node for the argument, which you can then
edit.
