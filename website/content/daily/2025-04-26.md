Imperative languages tend to express operations as a series of independent
statements. Code like this should be very familiar to most of us:

```rust
do_a();
then_do_b();
lastly_do_c();
```

This kind of code only makes sense, if those three functions have some kind of
side effect. They don't take and return any values, after all. So without a side
effect, neither of them would actually do anything.

Since purely functional languages track effects explicitly, traditionally by
[using values](/daily/2025-04-25), you would, at the very least, need to pass
some value through these functions to make that work. Maybe like this:

```rust
lastly_do_c(then_do_b(do_a(thing_required_for_a)))
```

Or, maybe more clearly, like this:

```
thing_required_for_a |> do_a |> then_do_b |> lastly_do_c
```

This is a distinction that arises naturally from the differences in how those
languages tend to work. With imperative languages, you get a series of
statements. With functional ones, function bodies tend to be single expressions.
Except, this distinction is no longer so clear when you consider a new
generation of functional languages. Let's get into that tomorrow.
