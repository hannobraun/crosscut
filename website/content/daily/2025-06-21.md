Yesterday, I introduced the possibility of expanding the concept of a trait to
[multiple types](/daily/2025-06-20) instead of just one. Let's use the word
"protocol" for this expanded concept, as I think that it captures the meaning of
having multiple types and multiple functions that relate them pretty well.

Here's an example of a simple multi-type protocol (using some pseudocode syntax
I just invented for this purpose):

```
Convert := protocol A, B {
	convert := fn A -> B
}
```

Here we define a protocol called `Convert`, declare that there are two types
involved, `A` and `B`, and that there exists a function called `convert` that
takes `A` and returns `B`.

Tomorrow, let's look into how we could use this protocol.
