At this point, I'm convinced that postfix syntax
[provides little to no advantage](/daily/2025-05-17) without stack-based
evaluation. But to drive that point home, let's look at the last in my
[list of reasons](/daily/2025-05-07) for switching to prefix syntax: The
["series of statements"](/daily/2025-04-27) approach brought about by using
algebraic effects.

Because if you're going to use values to track side effects, in the form of
monads or maybe using linear types (as I had previously planned), then every
function body ends up as one big expression. And then
[backwards prefix code](/daily/2025-04-26) that does not match the order of
execution, is a possibility everywhere. _If_ postfix syntax has an advantage,
it's in that scenario.

I think I've already shown that it probably doesn't. But even if I'm wrong, if
I'm missing something, using algebraic effects changes the equation. Because we
_do_ end up with a series of statements, and those statements _are_ in the order
in which they get executed in. Which further erodes any advantage that postfix
syntax could have.
