Using a free-form approach to structural code editing, makes changes to the
syntax tree [challenging](/daily/2025-05-03). But there's an alternative: You
don't let the user add and remove nodes freely. If they add a node, the editor
also adds its required children. They can't remove a required child without also
removing the parent. And they can't add extra children.

I'm calling this _restricted_ (versus free-form) structural code editing. It is
much easier on the compiler, since it doesn't need to cover as many edge cases.
And updating a node becomes much simpler.

You no longer need to compile children after changing a node, because if the
node changed, new (and suitable) children have been created. You don't need to
re-compile a parent after its children changed, because changes to children
can't make the parent invalid. The compiler becomes more efficient, and much
more manageable.
