If [automatic lifting is out](/daily/2025-04-18), that leaves me with the
problem of what to do about error handling. I have
[design goals](/daily/2025-04-09) that I want to see realized, after all. But I
believe that the solution actually lies outside of error handling itself.

Did you notice how all the time, I mention that this or that feature doesn't
interact well with [linear types](/daily/2024-07-09)? Well, I have noticed. And
I've come to believe that maybe linear types are another one of my
[innovation tokens] that I didn't spend wisely.

Move semantics are great. Rust has demonstrated that thoroughly. Rust has also
demonstrated that affine types (like linear types, but you can always drop them
implicitly) are a perfectly fine way to achieve that. This is boring technology
by now. But linear types aren't. And I think it's time to let them go too.
