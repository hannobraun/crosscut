There's one assumption in [yesterday's note](/daily/2024-08-25) that I'd like to
call out: The easy fix for determining the active expression in a reconstructed
stack frame depends on functions having exactly one exit point. If you allow
early returns, then functions can have multiple of those, and suddenly this is
no longer possible.

I use early returns in Rust, but discovered that they are more controversial
than I thought. Many seem to favor coding styles that avoid them completely,
claiming it will lead to cleaner code. Even before I came across call stack
reconstruction, I had decided I wanted to try that style in Caterpillar. Now it
turns out, this is critical for supporting this important feature.

This leads into a larger theme: Restricting what the language can do, making it
more simple as a result, can make it easier to understand. By the developer,
hopefully, but also by tooling (which then benefits the developer indirectly).
This is something that I want to explore in the design of Caterpillar. The
result will be unfamiliar to many, but I hope lead to a better experience.
