A few months back, I [created a Plan B](/daily/2025-06-01) for what I would do,
if my income failed. That plan would activate, if my income and savings fall
under a specific threshold, and would mark a significant change in my life and
efforts. Away from endeavors I do largely for idealistic reasons, towards work
that would have a bigger chance of making money.

That alone already helped a lot. I no longer need to constantly re-evaluate,
whenever something significant changes about my situation. But it also shifted
my view on my current projects. Because I still have income, I still have
savings, which is why Plan B is not active right now. And as long as it isn't, I
can _afford_ to work on more idealistic efforts.

When I realized that, it changed how I thought about Crosscut's use case. I
started seeing game development not as a mere stepping stone, chosen for its
technical merit. Something that I had to re-examine and question every step
along the way. But as something I would stay with indefinitely, while Plan B was
not active. A serious goal in itself.
