Let's recap: Crosscut's goal is to shorten the feedback loops in programming as
much as possible. A coarse-grained approach, like using the new code on the next
frame/update/request, is not enough to do that. Every single change must be
available immediately in the running program, right where it's made.

I have found that achieving these fine-grained updates is hard when code is
represented as text, because you lose information. You had the user make
specific changes in specific places. But if you then only look at the resulting
text, you're left guessing what _specifically_ changed in comparison with the
older version of that text.

I decided I wasn't going to deal with heuristics. Instead, Crosscut code would
be stored in a structured code database, and there was going to be an editor
that makes changes to that code database directly. That way, the system would
always know precisely what changed, and the user's intent would not be lost.

Tomorrow, let's talk about some of the the challenges of building such an
editor.
