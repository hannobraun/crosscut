If I could start developing games with Crosscut right now, somehow, that would
[solve a lot of problems](/daily/2025-06-05). Derisk the overall project.
Improve the outcome, by incorporating real experience along the way. Possibly
even contribute to funding. But that doesn't answer the question of how to do
that. As I said before, [Crosscut is not ready](/daily/2025-06-04)!

Here's where I had a technical insight: Crosscut is written in Rust, and through
a translation layer, Crosscut code can interact with Rust code. The
implementation of Crosscut itself and the core game engine code live below that
layer, as Rust code. And so far, I intended all game-specific code and some
auxiliary engine code to live above this layer, as Crosscut code.

But nothing stops me from moving this translation layer upwards. Have all engine
code and most game code in Rust. Only use Crosscut for a bit of scripting here
and there, to make some things easier to tweak in an interactive way. As
Crosscut matures, I could expand its role in my games. Until finally, it becomes
possible to write a whole game with it.
