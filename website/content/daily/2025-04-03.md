In addition to [what I showed yesterday](/daily/2025-04-02), the language
supports recursion, tuples, and I'm currently implementing bindings in the form
of function parameters. (Yes, I said [no tuples](/daily/2025-03-06), but I made
that decision after starting to implement them. It's just a stopgap until we get
proper records.)

Once proper function parameters are a thing, I want to amend them with support
for basic pattern matching. That's going to make the language Turing-complete,
which is where things start to get interesting. But all of that is going to be a
slow process. I expect much more work on the infrastructure to be necessary, to
support that.

And once the language can actually _do_ stuff, I'm going for live updates of the
running program (or hot reloading, whatever you wanna call it), debugger
functionality in the editor, and more along those lines. This interactive core
is the [highest priority](/daily/2025-02-22), after all.
