Expressions are composed of syntax nodes. The syntax nodes [we've seen so
far](/daily/2025-02-19), have one input and one output. Expressions made out of
those are structured like a list. But there actually are (or rather, should be;
I'm working on it) syntax nodes with multiple children. Which means expressions
actually are trees.

There will be various syntax nodes with multiple children. For example
[composite types](/daily/2025-02-10), tuples or records, which can be used to
aggregate multiple values and pass them to a function together. I've shown what
that could look like before:

```
(1, 2) +
```

Here we have a tuple value with two fields. Meaning in terms of syntax, we have
a tuple syntax node with two children. Each child gets is a separate
sub-expression, each of which starts with an active value of `nothing`. In this
case, they both produce a value of type `Integer`, creating the tuple `(1, 2)`
of type `(Integer, Integer)`, which is passed to the function `+`.
