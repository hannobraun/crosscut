These [parallels](/daily/2025-03-24) between `do` notation and how I want
Crosscut to work by default, I think those are interesting. And not only that, I
think they are encouraging. Because that might mean I'm on to something. Maybe I
have found a way to solve the same problems in a simpler way, that doesn't
require an alternate mode of writing code in the same language.

Let's be real though: I haven't done anything yet. These ideas are not
implemented in the language. They might not work out. Or maybe they'll do, but
there are huge drawbacks that are still invisible right now. This idea could
fail.

But whatever. So far, I see no reason why it would. And there's no better way to
find out, than to try.
