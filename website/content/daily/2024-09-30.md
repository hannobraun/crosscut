There are some subtleties to
[the approach I presented yesterday](/daily/2024-09-29). For example, why do we
append new code instead of updating existing functions? Well, because we might
have added more instructions, so the new function might not fit where the old
one was located.

And why replace old instructions with jumps to new ones? Wouldn't it be enough
to just replace the calls to new functions? Turns out, I didn't really consider
that recursion is the only form of iteration; so yes, it _is_ enough to just
replace the calls. Helping me think is 90% of the reason I write these daily
notes.

On top of that, there are some problems that need solving. Like, we can't append
new code forever. At some point we have to garbage-collect code that's no longer
active. And what happens, if new code expects or produces different types than
the old code? Short answer: The initial implementation will be far from perfect.
I'll have more details tomorrow.
