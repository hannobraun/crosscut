When [formatting a syntax tree](/daily/2025-05-08) using postfix syntax, my
first instinct was to start with the children in the upper-left, then indent
their parent. So a function call looked like this:

```
argument
	function
```

I was going to expand that into a more complicated (and realistic) example and
demonstrate how confusing this could get, but then realized that I could only
reproduce the worst problems I encountered by using
[free-form structural editing](/daily/2025-05-02). So the switch to
[restricted structural editing](/daily/2025-05-04) by itself solves a lot of
issues.

So that's one less reason to switch away from postfix syntax, I guess. But I
don't think this significantly weakens the
[overall argument](/daily/2025-05-07), as postfix syntax generally doesn't
interact well with restricted structural editing. And even if the worst problems
are fixed, that still leaves us with the general weirdness of this unfamiliar
representation.
