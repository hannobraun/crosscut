For now, I'll continue with the terminal editor,
[despite the problems](/daily/2025-04-04). It's not enough of an issue to
warrant investing in a different approach right now. But I expect that at some
point not too soon, I'll be switching to something more advanced.

Right now I expect that the next editor will be based on web technologies.
Because that will most likely be good enough, and provide support for the most
platforms with the least amount of effort. Specifically, I've been eyeing
[Dioxus].

There are other possibilities though which, while maybe a bit far-fetched, are
worth thinking about. Let's get into that tomorrow.
