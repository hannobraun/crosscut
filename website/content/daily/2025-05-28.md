Now that infix operators seem to be [part of the plan](/daily/2025-05-26), we
also need a way to group operations. Consider this example:

```
f: g: arg
```

Are we applying `f` to `g`, and that returns a function we apply to `arg`? Or
are we applying `g` to `arg`, and then `f` to the result of that? The way
editing works right now, it would probably end up as the latter. But we also
need a way to express the former.

Fortunately, I [don't want tuples](/daily/2025-03-06), so `(` and `)` are
completely free for that purpose:

```
( f: g ): arg
```
