[Error handling in Rust](/daily/2025-04-10) goes pretty far already in meeting
my [design goals](/daily/2025-04-09). You can mostly ignore error handling by
using `unwrap` or the combination of `?` and something like Anyhow. Then you can
come in later to tighten things up. But I see multiple problems.

If you go with the easy approach, you are limited at first in how you can handle
errors. You could check if an error occurred, or catch a panic (well,
[sometimes]). But you couldn't really handle the error, because the details are
lost. So you need custom error enums, and there are [tools to help]. But it's
still a lot of repetitive code to write.

More importantly, some of my design goals aren't met. If you do a
quick-and-dirty prototype, it's not at all obvious _which_ errors it could
trigger, and _where_. Your `main` function either returns nothing, if you rely
on panics, or something general like an `anyhow::Result`. To figure out the
"which" and the "where", you need to audit your whole code base.
