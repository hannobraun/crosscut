That's it, I guess! I've said all I have to say about the type system. (Except,
I already have notes for a series to recap and clarify one specific aspect of
it; but that's not a topic for today.) Next, I think it's time for an update on
development! After all, I've been working on the new prototype for
[more than two months](/daily/2025-02-04).

To be blunt, the whole thing has been a bit of a pain,
[exactly as predicted](/daily/2025-01-17). Having a code database has
wide-reaching consequences. The compiler is looking completely different than
any previous iteration. The custom [structure editor] I'm building has been a
source of much work; and it's very clear, it will take a long time to get right.

These factors are turning every little problem that I face into a micro-R&D
project. There's just so much to figure out. And that has made progress on the
actual language very, very slow. But so far, I still believe it's worth it. I
knew what I was getting into, after all.
