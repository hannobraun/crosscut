Having infix operators as the syntax for function application poses a question:
If we made it [this far](/daily/2025-05-28), why not build on that and use infix
operators more pervasively? Say, for math?

Maybe that step is inevitable at this point. Infix math operator are what people
expect after all. Plus, in addition to being unfamiliar, something like
`+: { 1 2 }` is more verbose than a simple `1 + 2`.

But I'm not there yet. Function application is special, so special syntax seems
justified. But math, which could just as well be done using regular old
functions? I'm not convinced. Not yet.
