The most recent change I was making to the previous prototype, was to add a
[static type system](/daily/2025-01-26) with full type inference. Which turned
out to be too ambitious. I got the type inference 95% working, but those last 5%
turned out to be very challenging, with no end in sight.

To be clear, this alone would have been easy to fix: Just roll back the most
recent changes and require explicit type annotations. Or switch to a dynamic
type system. Or not have any type system for a while longer. So this work, while
being the trigger that got me thinking about a new prototype, wasn't actually
the reason I started working on that.

But it helped me recognize all the other ways in which the previous prototype
had been overly ambitious. And more importantly, how I could address those.
