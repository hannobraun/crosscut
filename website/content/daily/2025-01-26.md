The next item on the list of the previous prototype's
[many problems](/daily/2025-01-10) is the type system. This was the most recent
thing I worked on, and it was actually the trigger for starting to think about a
new prototype.

The previous prototype started out being untyped. Meaning there wasn't _any_
type system, not even a dynamic one. Everything was just a 32-bit number,
similar to how Forth or assembly tend to work. I devised this as a stopgap, to
get the language started without the initial need for designing and building a
type system.

And it worked in that capacity! If I'm not forgetting something, this was the
first prototype that I actually managed to build a somewhat complete game in.
But it was also limiting the language. Most importantly, it was preventing code
updates from working reliably. So I started transitioning to a static type
system with full type inference, which turned out to be very difficult.
