I don't have experience with structural code editors. I never worked in an
environment that provided one. I just [determined](/daily/2025-05-01) that I was
going to need something like that. And then I went ahead, starting to figure out
what to build, from first principles.

My first approach was very free-form. You were editing a syntax tree instead of
text, but you weren't restricted in how to do that. You could freely change
existing nodes, as well as add and remove their children, parents, or siblings.
Every time you did that, the compiler would figure out if the result was valid,
and display the appropriate errors.

This worked well for a while. But as my basic placeholder language grew into
something that started to resemble a real one, the free-form approach showed
signs of breaking down. The compiler became more complex, to the point where I
wasn't sure that I wanted to continue along this path.
