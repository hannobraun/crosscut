Yesterday, I [started introducing](/daily/2025-02-08) the new syntax and
evaluation model. It takes inspiration from functional languages, and limits
functions to having exactly one input and one output value. That might seem too
restrictive: some operations just have multiple inputs. Otherwise, how would you
model something like addition or multiplication?

Functional languages like Haskell or the ML family, get around that by using
[currying]. Consider something like `+ 1 2` (which is a syntax that neither of
the aforementioned languages use for addition; but let's stick with it for this
example). This isn't actually a single call taking two arguments; it's two
function calls, taking one argument each!

The first call (or _application_, as the more math-minded functional languages
call it) is `+ 1`. It returns a new function, which takes a single argument and
adds `1` to it. That new function is what receives the argument `2`. I don't
think this would work with postfix syntax though. So we need a different
solution.
