As a quick amendment to [yesterday's note](/daily/2024-10-09), I want to note
that my ideas on how to represent keywords syntactically are inspired by Chuck
Moore's [colorForth].

Now that I'm thinking about it, I realize that a lot of my thinking related to
the [code database](/daily/2024-07-29) probably originates from reading about
colorForth. Although many of the specifics are more directly inspired by
[Unison].
