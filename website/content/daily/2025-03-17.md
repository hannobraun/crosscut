Mixing up the concepts of [nominal and opaque types](/daily/2025-03-13) may not
be a good idea in the first place. And certainly, doing that and having
per-field control over visibility are not the only alternatives. What about
having both `nominal` and `opaque` in the language, as separate concepts?

One takes any type and makes it nominal, as previously proposed. The other takes
any type and makes all of its fields (or cases, for a variant?) private. That
would allow structural but opaque types, which is a
[nonsensical combination](/daily/2025-03-12). But like with
[anonymous nominal types](/daily/2025-03-11), that's probably not too bad, as
long as it's clear what every feature does.

It's important to remind myself, I'm not looking for a final solution here. That
can only come out of a long process of testing and real-world use. What I'm
looking for is a sensible first draft. And separate `nominal` and `opaque`
keywords might be just that.
