Except for the erroneous
[concatenation of two integer literals](/daily/2025-02-18) from yesterday, we've
only seen expressions that consist of a single syntax node. Let's look into some
more complex, but still valid, expressions today.

```
64 halve
```

Here, we're using a `halve` function that takes an integer as input and returns
another integer (divided by two) as output. Such a function currently doesn't
exist in Crosscut, but a host could easily define it.

I've talked about the [active value](/daily/2025-02-17) before. Here, the active
value at the beginning of the expression is `nothing` (of type `Nothing`). After
the `64`, it's `64` (of type `Integer`). After the `halve`, it's `32` (still of
type `Integer`).

We can build more complex expressions, by chaining more function applications of
the appropriate type:

```
64 halve halve double double
```

In this one, if the `double` function does what its name suggests and multiplies
by two, we end up with `64` again.
