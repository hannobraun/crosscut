I'd like to call out something about yesterday's
[detour into modules](/daily/2025-03-02), that is going to be relevant for data
types: Modules return the items they export as a data structure with named
fields. Which means, to assign a name to an item, you don't need anything else
in the item itself.

Functions, for example, are always anonymous when created. You assign a name to
them by exporting them under that name from a module (or maybe some other means,
like a local binding). Same goes for data types. If we assign a name to them
through a mechanism in the module system, we don't need to build that into the
syntax for defining data types itself.

Okay, this wasn't a lot of information about modules, but it should be enough to
continue without data types. So let's do that soon, and pick up the module
system at some point in the future, when I know more about how they could work.
