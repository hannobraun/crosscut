Okay, so I've [re-invented monads](/daily/2025-03-23). But in a totally weird
way, with postfix operators and [automatic lifting](/daily/2025-03-22). I didn't
do it this way because I _wanted_ it to be weird though. This fell out of a
long, iterative, and still ongoing design process. A strong focus of that design
process has been _convenience_.

And this is interesting to me. Because it seems to be a recurring theme in the
world of functional programming languages, that dealing with monads turns out to
be inconvenient. And then, to fix that, [`do` notation] gets introduced.

I'm far from being an expert on `do` notation. But it seems to me, that it has a
twofold purpose: to hide the inconvenience of explicitly operating on monads,
and to put those operations into a linear sequence. Which is exactly what I'm
trying to do with my approach. But in Crosscut, this wouldn't be a special
notation. It would be the default (and hopefully only) mode of doing things.
