I think it has become clear, that I like postfix syntax. But I also think that
prefix syntax has [one critical advantage](/daily/2025-02-14) that is too big to
ignore: It gives you the context of what's happening first, which helps you
understand the following details. (It might have more critical advantages.
That's just the one that is very clear to me right now.)

The problem, I believe, is that whether it's better to provide context first, or
to [present code in order of execution](/daily/2025-02-12), depends on the
specific situation. So either style is going to be worse _sometimes_. But just
as we can invent language features to
[offset the disadvantage](/daily/2025-02-13) of prefix syntax, we can do the
same for postfix syntax. Consider this:

```
(detail_a, detail_b)
	important_behavior_that_puts_the_details_into_context
```

We could invent some kind of optional prefix syntax to improve this example,
like this:

```
important_behavior_that_puts_the_details_into_context:
	(detail_a, detail_b)
```

Here, the `:` (which might be too subtle, but it's just an example), marks the
application of the function with the long name as using prefix syntax. We could
choose to write it like that, whenever we think that provides an advantage.
