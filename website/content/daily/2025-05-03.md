Some syntax nodes are only valid, if their children are of the correct type and
number. Take an `fn` node for example, which is the parent node for a function
literal. It needs exactly two children, parameter and body. The parameter needs
to be a pattern, the body an expression. Anything else, and the `fn` node is not
valid.

If you follow a [free-form](/daily/2025-05-02) approach, that turns into a
confusing mess pretty fast: You edit a node, you check its context (parent, and
position among siblings), then you compile it depending on that context. Next,
you compile its children, because compiling the original node could have changed
their context. And so on, recursively.

At some point, you'll encounter a child that doesn't change as a result of the
re-compilation. Then you're done with that part. But of course, for all the
children that _did_ change, you need to compile their parents again. Including
the original node, but also its parents, up to the root. None of that is
impossible to manage, but it's more complicated than I'd like.
