Okay, so I went over the [problems of the old prototype](/daily/2025-01-10), and
explained how I intend to address most of them. What I left out, was the syntax
and evaluation model, because just as I started to write about that,
[my plans changed](/daily/2025-01-25). I tried to go with a tried and true
approach but then... couldn't.

I think that this is, at the same time, a big weakness and a big strength of
mine. I just don't know how to do the boring thing, if I think there may be a
better way. In this case, I saw how the tried and true approach wasn't great for
Crosscut. Meanwhile, I had come up with an alternative model. So now I'm working
on that.

Maybe I'll look back at this in a few months, and call it over-ambition. It
wouldn't be the first time. But the fact is, my new model looks promising. There
are no open questions at this point. It's not clearly a bad idea. So I'll try.
And if it doesn't work, I'll try something else.
