Sometimes I write these daily notes on the day they come out. But unless the
topic is an update on current events, it's more likely that I have a queue
that's a few days long. Then I just give a final polish to the next note before
publishing it, and spend the bulk of my writing time for that day on the rest of
the queue.

A few days ago, when I wrote the note that was originally supposed to come at
this point in the series, I was worried about scope creep in the debugger. How
can I prevent that from spiraling out of control? Is there a more minimal
approach that I am missing?

And somehow, the mere act of writing these questions down, _instantly_ triggered
new ideas on how to simplify the debugger, making it less of a burden going
forward. I've already implemented some of them. _That_ is the reason I write
these daily notes! (Certainly not because anybody is interested in reading them
yet ðŸ˜‚)
