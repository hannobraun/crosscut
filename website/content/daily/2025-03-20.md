I laid out an idea yesterday, about tying variant types into the language
[more closely](/daily/2025-03-19). The result would be less strict than what
Rust does. More loose. And it could become confusing, making it hard to follow
what type an expression evaluates to.

But remember, Crosscut is intended to be [used with tooling](/daily/2024-07-21).
It is not designed to be read from a plain text file, without additional
software support. And if that tooling is available, and can show you the type of
every expression, then maybe this approach is _not_ too confusing.

So given all that, I wonder if we can even take it one step further. Let's say
you have a function that takes `A` and returns `X`. If you apply it to a value
of type `A`, you expect to get a value of type `X` back. But what about applying
it to a value of type `variant { A, B }`? Wouldn't it be natural, to then
automatically get back a `variant { X, B }`?
