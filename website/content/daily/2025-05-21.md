Let's talk about function application! When referring to a function, many
languages distinguish between two cases: Applying ("calling") it, or referring
to it as a value (a function pointer). In Rust, that's the difference between
`function()` and `function`.

Crosscut can also make this distinction. It does so by using an explicit node in
the syntax tree to apply functions, an idea I stole from [EYG]. Right now, this
is reflected in the syntax very directly:

```
apply
	function
	argument
```

This is just a placeholder. Remember, the priority right now is to have a syntax
that is simple and very regular, so I can make progress in other areas.
Eventually, this is going to look different. And over the next few days, I'd
like to talk about some of my ideas.
