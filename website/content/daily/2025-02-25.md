I'd like to introduce the concepts of structural and nominal typing. I'm going
to talk about some aspects of the type system next, and this is going to be
required background. Let's start with structural typing. Consider this function
in Rust:

```rust
fn measure_width() -> (Value, Unit) { ... }
```

It's a function that returns two values. Except, a function in Rust can only
return one value, really, so I've bundled those up into one tuple. Please note
that this tuple is an anonymous data type. I just wrote down its structure here,
the data it contains, without giving it a name.

I can define another function that's similar:

```rust
fn measure_height() -> (Value, Unit) { ... }
```

The return type looks the same.

And not only do they _look_ the same; in a very real way, they _are_ the same:

```rust
let width = measure_width();
let height = measure_height();

let max_dimension = if width > height {
	width
} else {
	height
};
```

This works. The type of `max_dimension` is `(Value, Unit)`, which is also the
type of either of those return values. Even though we've defined that type in
two locations (and could define it in more), it's the same type. Because it's
the _structure_ of the type that counts. This is _structural typing_.
