On top of being [there from the start](/daily/2025-01-16) in the new prototype,
interactive programming is built on top of the
[code database](/daily/2025-01-11), and integrated with a
[custom editor](/daily/2025-01-12) that directly modifies the code database.

As I said earlier, there's a clear risk of this leading me
[down a rabbit hole](/daily/2025-01-15). It might be biting off more than I can
chew. Too ambitious. But I do sincerely believe that this tightly integrated,
interactive core, is the most sincere expression of the core concept of
immediacy. It's worth a try, and when [if not now](/daily/2025-01-08)?

And honestly, I _expect_ this to turn into a huge pain. But unless it grows
fully out of control, that pain might just be worth it. Because this is the one
thing that Crosscut, if it succeeds, is going to do better than anything else.
Type system, performance, game engine features; those are all important! But not
nearly as important as immediacy.
