If functions have [one input and one output](/daily/2025-02-08), that means
there is always one "current value". Let's call this the "active value". I don't
know if that nomenclature is going to stick, but it'll do for now.

Expressions transform the active value. If you're going to concatenate multiple
expressions into a larger one, they might not cleanly fit together. Especially
if [composite values](/daily/2025-02-10) are involved, that a given expression
might only need parts of. So we'll want combinators to fit in between and
convert as necessary.

This is something I have thought about quite a few times, but never very deeply.
There's definitely design work left to do. I find [optics] to be an interesting
direction, although I'm certain there's going to be more to it. So combinators
will surely become a topic here at some point.
