Let's move on in my [list of reasons](/daily/2025-05-07) for switching to prefix
syntax and talk about combinators.

The big draw of postfix syntax is that you naturally write code in the order
that it's evaluated in. So `a b c` instead of `c(b(a()))`. But this simple
example only works, if the outputs and inputs of those functions match exactly.
`a` must produce what `b` consumes, which must produce what `c` consumes.

And most of the time, it won't be that simple. Maybe `a` returns a record with
two fields, one of which is required as `b`'s argument, the other is consumed by
`c`, together with whatever `b` returns. Or something along those lines.
Tomorrow, let's look into ways to handle a more complex case like this.
