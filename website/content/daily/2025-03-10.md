Okay, so types are [structurally typed by default](/daily/2025-03-09), even if
you assign a name to them. In that case, the name is just a type alias.

But I'm a big believer in static typing and its ability to make code more
reliable. And nominal typing is a big part of that. Under the hood, both
_meters_ and _meters per second_ might be encoded using the same type. But if
you use one in place of the other, that's a guaranteed bug. The type system
should be able to prevent that, and that requires nominal typing.

Tomorrow, I'd like to present my idea for supporting that.
