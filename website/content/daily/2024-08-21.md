If you've been reading my notes on
[pattern-matching functions](/daily/2024-08-17) over the last few days, you
might wonder if this isn't a bit of an overloaded concept, and if it might be
better to split it into two simple and orthogonal ones: Functions without
pattern matching, and a standalone pattern matching expression. At least that's
what I thought when I was writing it.

But if you sit down to implement that, you might notice that the branches of a
match expression are pretty similar to anonymous functions. And then you're left
with a dilemma: Re-use anonymous functions to represent match branches, or
include an almost-like-a-function-but-not-quite thing as part of match
expressions. At least that's what happened to me.

The latter option is kinda out. If match expressions contain almost-functions,
then they aren't really orthogonal _to_ functions. This defeats the whole point
of having two _orthogonal_ concepts. But reusing functions won't work, for the
same reason that sent me down this road in the first place: It means multiple
branches [can't capture the same linear value](/daily/2024-08-14).
